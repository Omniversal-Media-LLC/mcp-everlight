<p>I bought a iPad Magic Keyboard to use with the new iPad when it gets here but I’m wondering if I can use it with my Mac mini in the meantime or maybe even my iphone?</p>

<p>The <strong>iPad Magic Keyboard</strong> (the one with the floating hinge and trackpad) is designed specifically for iPads and connects via the Smart Connector — not Bluetooth or USB — so:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No</strong>, you cannot use it with your <strong>Mac mini</strong> (unless you’re talking about a separate <em>Magic Keyboard</em> that pairs via Bluetooth — let me know if that's what you meant).</li>
<li><strong>No</strong>, it won’t work with your <strong>iPhone</strong> either — the Smart Connector interface isn't compatible with iOS devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternatives-in-the-meantime">Alternatives in the Meantime:</h3>
<p>If you want to use a keyboard with your Mac mini or iPhone:
- Consider a <strong>Bluetooth keyboard</strong> (like Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard or any third-party one).
- Or if you have a <strong>USB keyboard</strong>, you can plug it directly into the Mac mini or use an adapter for the iPhone with a Lightning or USB-C to USB-A/C dongle.</p>
<p>If you <em>did</em> buy the <strong>Bluetooth version</strong> of the Magic Keyboard (not the iPad Smart Connector one), then yes — you can pair it with both the Mac mini and the iPhone.</p>
<p>Want help confirming which one you actually bought? Just send the model number or a photo of the box.</p>

<p>Thanks for the photo — that confirms everything.</p>
<p>You purchased the <strong>Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)</strong> — model <strong>A2995</strong> (MWR23LL/A), which is the newest <strong>Smart Connector</strong> version designed <em>exclusively</em> for the 2024 iPad Pro (M4 chip). That means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It does not use Bluetooth</strong>, USB-C, or any wireless pairing method.</li>
<li><strong>It will not work at all with your Mac mini or iPhone</strong>, even physically — the Smart Connector pins only align with the iPad Pro's body and magnetic dock.</li>
<li>It won’t power on or function unless attached to the M4 iPad Pro itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-short">In short:</h3>
<p>It’s a gorgeous and premium keyboard — but totally iPad-exclusive. You’ll have to wait until the new iPad arrives to put it to use.</p>
<p>If you need something in the meantime, I can help you find a cheap Bluetooth keyboard that <em>does</em> work with Mac, iPhone, and iPad all together — just say the word.</p>

<p>Ah okay cool well it should be here on Tuesday so we’ll go from there I guess</p>

<p>Perfect — that’s not far off at all. Once it arrives, you’ll be able to just snap it on and go. No setup, no pairing — pure magnetic magic.</p>
<p>When you’re ready, I can walk you through optimizing it for multitasking, keyboard shortcuts, and even some hidden gestures that make it feel closer to a laptop setup. Just say when.</p>
<p>Until then, we wait… like Jedi awaiting the arrival of our lightsaber.</p>
