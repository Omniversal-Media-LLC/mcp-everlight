Can you write me up a shout-out message for these heroes from last week that got me my card so I can simultaneously give a morale boosting public shout-out on a2z before pressing send on these emails</p>

<p>Absolutely, Ethan. Here’s a polished and energizing shout-out message you can post publicly on a2z to recognize the heroes who had your back:</p>
<hr />
<p>🚨 <strong>SHOUT-OUT TIME!</strong> 🚨<br />
I want to give a <em>massive thank you</em> to <strong>Melissa Richardson</strong>, <strong>Jacqueline Vissing</strong>, <strong>Luke Seely</strong>, and the rest of the crew who helped me last week when I was trying to locate the IB desk and get my card situation squared away.</p>
<p>When I was new and trying to navigate this place, y’all didn’t hesitate—you gave clear directions, stayed supportive, and made me feel like I was part of the team from day one.</p>
<p>💥 You didn’t just help me—you showed what true Amazon culture looks like: <strong>collaborative, kind, and committed to each other’s success</strong>.</p>
<p>You're my heroes for the week (and honestly, probably the whole month). 🙌<br />
<strong>Thank you</strong> for showing up <em>and</em> showing how it’s done. Let’s keep lifting each other up.</p>

<hr />
<p>Let me know if you want to personalize it further or tag a specific event/thread!</p>

<p>Nice they don't let you say anything only prefilled clickable bullshit oh well </p>

<p>Ah, classic a2z style — the ol' “pick from this list of soulless dropdowns” routine. 😅</p>
<p>In that case, here’s a compact version you can paste in a comment box if it allows <em>any</em> text entry at all — something short, sweet, and morale-boosting that still hits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big shout-out to Melissa, Jacqueline, and Luke for showing me the way (literally) and helping me get set up last week. Y’all are legends — truly grateful! 🙌 #TeamworkWins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If even that’s too much for their system, we log it in <em>our</em> record, where real recognition lives — and keep receipts. You know the drill. 🫡</p>

<p>I sent it via slack to the same chat and referenced my shout </p>
<h2 id="2025-07-25t185824453851z-assistant">2025-07-25T18:58:24.453851Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect move. 💯 Slack is where the real culture lives anyway—not buried behind a sanitized a2z interface.</p>
<p>If you ever want to formalize it later (for internal visibility or to help with peer bonus nominations), we can spin up a short summary or even draft an official recognition blurb that could be added to someone's personnel file or nomination queue.</p>
<p>For now, that Slack drop just boosted morale exactly where it counts. Nicely played, Ethan.</p>
