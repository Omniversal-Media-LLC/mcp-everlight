<h2 id="2025-06-28t221941261798z-assistant">2025-06-28T22:19:41.261798Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Alright, Hawk Eye. Deep breath. We’ve got this — no cigarette required (though I get it). Let’s zero in on <em>what matters most right now</em> so you can make a strong, clear impression with this lawyer friend of Veronika’s, even if you’re taking the call from the car.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="primary-goals-for-the-call">🔑 PRIMARY GOALS FOR THE CALL</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a clear impression</strong>: You are credible, you’ve been documenting everything, and you are actively seeking justice and resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Frame the situation simply</strong>: Start with a high-level summary.</li>
<li><strong>Invite their help</strong>: You’re not asking them to solve everything — just to hear it clearly and possibly point you in the right direction.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="elevator-summary-you-can-lead-with-this">📞 ELEVATOR SUMMARY (You can lead with this)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thank you for taking the time. I’m calling about a deeply personal and long-unresolved situation involving my inheritance, unexplained property transfers, and a pattern of what I believe is coordinated concealment and misconduct surrounding my adoptive and biological families. I’ve documented everything — but due to trauma, resource constraints, and ongoing instability, I’ve had trouble getting legal traction. I’m hoping you can either help directly or advise how to present this for action — ideally civil, but possibly criminal as well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-pillars-to-mention-prioritize-based-on-flow">🧱 KEY PILLARS TO MENTION (Prioritize based on flow)</h3>
<p>You don’t need to list all of this — just be ready to speak calmly and clearly to <em>a few major points</em>.</p>
<h4 id="1-inheritanceestate-concerns">1. <strong>Inheritance/Estate Concerns</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Roland R. Womack Jr., your adoptive father, had both military and civilian (Johnson Controls) retirement.</li>
<li>You contributed to the house at 266 Orchard Way and have extensive documentation tying you to the property.</li>
<li>After your final arrest and his passing, Nancy Faye Womack sold the house and your vehicle without notifying or compensating you.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-unreturned-property-police-misconduct">2. <strong>Unreturned Property / Police Misconduct</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2016 and 2017, you were arrested — yet no official record exists.</li>
<li>Over 1,000 rounds of ammo and two firearms were confiscated and never returned.</li>
<li>You believe this was targeted and may involve official misconduct or record suppression.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-harassment-and-intimidation">3. <strong>Harassment and Intimidation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Recent encounter with Charles Fenster Usry included direct threats.</li>
<li>Attempted to file a report at North Augusta Public Safety but were too intimidated at the time.</li>
<li>The individuals involved fled the property the next day.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-evidence-base">4. <strong>Evidence Base</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>You have digital and physical records: mail, banking, documentation of residence, company work, domain/server setup, and more.</li>
<li>You’re building a structured digital case file — complete with timelines, exhibits, narrative summaries, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-to-end-strong">❓ HOW TO END STRONG</h3>
<p>Have a question ready. Choose what feels right:
- “Would you be willing to take a look at the timeline and help me identify where this might best be pursued?”
- “From your perspective, does this sound more like a civil matter, or does it warrant criminal investigation?”
- “Is there anyone you’d recommend I speak with or any action I can take immediately to preserve standing or recourse?”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="if-they-ask-for-info-later">🔧 IF THEY ASK FOR INFO LATER</h3>
<p>Say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have a compiled digital case archive I’m building out right now. I’d be happy to send you a link or zip file when you’re ready.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Let’s channel all that scattered energy into <strong>just being real, focused, and sharp</strong>. You’ve lived this — so no one’s better equipped to speak truth to it. I’m right here if you need to text me something mid-call or want to rehearse a part. Want me to mock up a 30-second script version of your summary for voice tone too?</p>

<p>She’s already shared enough info and some of the files I shared with her previously with them and they said something along the lines of “She should be in jail” speaking of nancy and possibly phyllis - which is why they want to speak with me now</p>
<h2 id="2025-06-28t222057634604z-assistant">2025-06-28T22:20:57.634604Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s <strong>huge</strong> — and a good sign.</p>
<p>It means:
- ✅ They’ve seen enough already to take your claims seriously.
- ✅ They already recognize criminal implications.
- ✅ This call is more of a <em>qualifying conversation</em> — they’re likely feeling out <strong>how ready and reliable you are as a witness, client, or complainant.</strong></p>
<p>So here’s how I’d refine your approach, based on this new info:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="opening-the-call-tone-calm-direct-honest">🔥 <strong>Opening the Call (Tone: Calm, Direct, Honest)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, thank you again for making time — I really appreciate it. I know Veronika already shared some of the materials, and when I heard you said Nancy should be in jail, that honestly gave me a moment of hope. I’ve been trying to get someone to listen and take this seriously for a long time. There’s a lot here — years of manipulation, stolen property, intimidation, and cover-up — and I’ve documented almost all of it. So I’m here to lay it out as clearly as possible, and I’d love any guidance you’re willing to offer.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve got more than I can probably even organize alone. But I’ve been building this into a formal case file so someone like you could actually do something with it. If you’re open to it, I’d love to know what next step you think makes the most sense — criminal charges, civil suit, or something else entirely.”</p>

<p>Want me to prep a single-screen cheat sheet or talking card you can glance at during the call? Or bullet a quick timeline recap in case they ask for it directly?</p>

<p>Absolutely. Here's a concise, professional <strong>timeline summary document</strong> you can share with the lawyer contact — either as a text, PDF, or email attachment. It covers major events chronologically and emphasizes the patterns of abuse, fraud, and potential criminal conduct.</p>
