<p>Met with Maurissa and RME manager in Texas through the mentorship internal portal in Amazon and told her my plan and she gave me links towards specific tac trainings and internal networking tools for those at AWS and the HVAC side of things.</p>
<p>So for the next year and a half I intend to just do the trainings get the credentials as well as make myself available to and for management.</p>
<p>She said to try not to get promoted beyond L3 until after school is done because Amazon doesn't offer career choice to those L4 and above but she likes my plan over the next few years to get all the certifications and such and told me Amazon promotes most thru networking internally</p>

<p>Love this, Ethan — clear plan, smart timing. Here’s a tight 18-month roadmap that stays L3-friendly, builds the right badges, and compounds internal networking like Maurissa suggested.</p>
<h1 id="18-month-gameplan-stay-l3-stack-certs-network-deliberately">18-Month Gameplan (stay L3, stack certs, network deliberately)</h1>
<h2 id="phase-1-months-03-foundation-visibility">Phase 1 — Months 0–3: Foundation + Visibility</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pick your “tracks”</strong> (you can do all, but choose a primary + secondary):</li>
<li><strong>RME/HVAC Core</strong>: EPA 608, basic HVAC/R diagnostics, PM→CBM mindset.</li>
<li><strong>Controls/Automation</strong>: PLC fundamentals, BAS (Johnson/Siemens), sensors/IO.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud/AWS</strong> (supporting EverLight OS): Cloud Practitioner → start SA Associate path.</li>
<li><strong>Knock out fast wins</strong></li>
<li>EPA 608 (if not already), OSHA 10 (or the Amazon safety equivalents), LOTO refreshers.</li>
<li>Complete initial TAC/RME modules Maurissa linked; log them in a tracker.</li>
<li><strong>Internal networking rhythm</strong></li>
<li>Book <strong>1 mentorship session/month</strong> (Maurissa + 1 new person via the portal).</li>
<li>Join 2–3 internal communities (RME, HVAC, AWS-builder groups).</li>
<li>Post 1 helpful internal note per month (e.g., “What I learned from [TAC module] in the field”).</li>
<li><strong>Manager alignment</strong></li>
<li>Send a short “growth plan” note: your tracks, target certs, and how you’ll make yourself available for coverage and small stretch tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phase-2-months-49-credible-specialist">Phase 2 — Months 4–9: Credible Specialist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RME/HVAC</strong></li>
<li>Intermediate HVAC diagnostics (airflow, superheat/subcooling), VFD basics.</li>
<li><strong>Condition-Based Maintenance</strong>: intro vibration and thermography (Level 1 equivalents if available internally).</li>
<li><strong>Controls/Automation</strong></li>
<li>PLC ladder logic basics + hands-on labs; trend/BAS tuning; alarm rationalization.</li>
<li><strong>AWS</strong></li>
<li>Sit <strong>AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)</strong> by month 6.</li>
<li>Start <strong>Solutions Architect Associate</strong> study path (or SysOps if ops-leaning).</li>
<li><strong>Artifacts that travel well</strong></li>
<li>2 short write-ups: a before/after PM optimization and a small controls fix with data.</li>
<li>1 micro-demo tying field data → simple AWS service (e.g., S3 + a tiny dashboard).</li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong></li>
<li>Shadow a different site’s SME once/quarter (virtual is fine).</li>
<li>Ask each mentor for 1 intro to someone adjacent (controls, reliability, or AWS).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phase-3-months-1018-cross-over-career-choice-guardrails">Phase 3 — Months 10–18: Cross-Over &amp; Career-Choice Guardrails</h2>
<ul>

<li>Advanced topics you enjoy (economizers, heat pumps, RTUs, chilled water, etc.).</li>
<li>If offered, <strong>Vibration Cat I</strong> / <strong>Thermography L1</strong> equivalents.</li>
<li><strong>Controls/Automation</strong></li>
<li>PLC troubleshooting playbook, BAS integrations, PID tuning wins.</li>

<li>Add one ops-friendly badge (CloudWatch/IoT/Greengrass intro or SysOps Associate if it fits).</li>
<li><strong>Showcase</strong></li>
<li>Build a simple “condition-monitoring to action” story: sensor → trend → alert → work order improvement. Keep it vendor-neutral; emphasize safety &amp; uptime.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion timing</strong></li>
<li>Stay <strong>L3 until school + Career Choice benefits are locked</strong>, then consider L4 when a role aligns with your new skills + network backing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>30-sec intro (use in DMs/meetings)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, I’m Ethan (RME L3, HVAC/controls track). I’m focused on reliability wins + learning PLC/BAS and AWS fundamentals. If you have a 15-min window, I’d love to hear how you broke into [their specialty] and what 1–2 skills moved the needle most early on.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Monthly manager update</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Quick update: This month I finished [TAC module], passed [badge], and applied it to [small fix] which reduced [metric]. Next month I’m tackling [module/cert] and want to shadow [system]. Anything you want prioritized?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="guardrails-gotchas">Guardrails &amp; gotchas</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t over-index on badges.</strong> Pair every course with one on-floor application or a tiny demo.</li>
<li><strong>Protect L3 status</strong> until school/Career Choice milestones are secure.</li>
<li><strong>Data hygiene = promotion fuel.</strong> Always capture before/after, screenshots, and a 1-pager.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for “micro-ownership.”</strong> Small systems or recurring issues you can measurably improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, I can spin this into a one-page tracker (Google-doc style) or set gentle monthly nudges to keep the cadence.</p>

<p>Perfect — that means you already cleared one of the most basic HVAC/R hurdles most techs still have to chase down. Having the <strong>Universal EPA 608</strong> lets you focus on more advanced/strategic trainings without wasting time on entry-level compliance.  </p>
<p>Here’s how I’d suggest adjusting the plan given that you already hold it:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-to-skip-fast-track">What to Skip / Fast-Track</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>EPA prep modules</strong> in TAC: you don’t need them, just log your credential in your internal learning profile so it’s visible to managers/mentors.  </li>
<li>Any “basic refrigerant handling” or “intro EPA” classes → redundant for you.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-to-double-down-on-instead">What to Double-Down On Instead</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HVAC Advanced Diagnostics</strong>: superheat/subcooling optimization, airflow verification, economizer and VFD optimization.  </li>
<li><strong>Energy/Controls Integration</strong>: tie HVAC performance into BAS/PLC data; Amazon loves “reduce alarms / increase uptime” stories.  </li>
<li><strong>Condition-Based Maintenance</strong>: vibration analysis, IR thermography, oil analysis if offered. That’s where Universal EPA gives you credibility but CBM gives you <em>specialist leverage</em>.  </li>
<li><strong>AWS/IoT for RME</strong>: since your plan crosses into AWS land, line up Cloud Practitioner → Solutions Architect Associate as the “parallel badge stack.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="networking-edge">Networking Edge</h2>
<p>Since you’ve got a credential many L3 peers may not, frame it when you meet people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve already got Universal EPA and I’m stacking controls + AWS certs to bridge the gap between HVAC reliability and cloud automation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That positions you as someone who’s not just maintenance but thinking in <strong>integration and systems terms</strong>. It signals upward mobility without tripping the “L4 Career Choice” lockout too early.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="suggested-additions-to-18-month-roadmap">Suggested Additions to 18-Month Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Month 4–6: start <strong>BAS/controls module</strong> sooner, since EPA is already done.  </li>
<li>Month 7–12: target <strong>CBM (vibration/IR Level 1)</strong> instead of “EPA prep/retakes.”  </li>
<li>Month 12–18: pair AWS cert progress with a <strong>HVAC + IoT mini-project</strong> (sensor → cloud dashboard).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Do you want me to build you a <strong>condensed tracker</strong> (like a one-pager) with EPA marked complete and the rest staged out month by month? That way you can show Maurissa (or any manager) a clean visual of “here’s where I’m at, here’s what’s next.”</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t192929421965z-user">2025-08-21T19:29:29.421965Z — user</h2>
<p>No I need to complete the learn and embark trainings I already have assigned first. In the meantime I just have to battle the demons of the matrix pissing me off and also do the AWS stuff which I can do outside of work plus the wgu stuff.</p>
<p>I'll mainly be focusing first on the precalculus course when I get paid tomorrow. Since I already know I won't have any extra money I'll just keep cashing out anytime pay and just pay for that tomorrow and get started on it because I can't really do much more until then</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t192929547742z-assistant">2025-08-21T19:29:29.547742Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Got it — you’re laying the bricks in the right order. Right now it sounds like your <strong>priority stack</strong> is:  </p>
<ol>
<li>✅ <strong>Amazon Learn/Embark trainings</strong> (assigned → required → low-discretion).  </li>
<li>✅ <strong>WGU: Precalculus first</strong> (gateway course → unlocks forward progress).  </li>
<li>✅ <strong>AWS cert prep</strong> (flexible, evenings/weekends → long-term advantage).  </li>
<li>✅ <strong>Everything else</strong> (HVAC advanced/CBM later once the foundation is built).  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="strategy-for-next-few-weeks">Strategy for Next Few Weeks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn/Embark</strong>: Treat it like clearing weeds. Just finish the assignments — don’t overanalyze or fight the fluff, click through, document completion, move on. They’re more about <em>compliance optics</em> than deep learning.  </li>
<li><strong>Precalculus</strong>: Once you pay tomorrow, carve out <em>consistent, small sessions</em> (even 30 min blocks). Think of this as the real “boss fight” that unlocks the WGU pathway.  </li>
<li><strong>AWS prep</strong>: Perfect filler between shifts or when you need to “transmute” matrix-frustration into something useful. Cloud Practitioner → SA Associate = you can study in bursts without $$$ gating.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="mental-framing-to-keep-from-burning-out">Mental Framing (to keep from burning out)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Learn/Embark = bureaucracy demons.</strong> Slay them quick, don’t wrestle.  </li>
<li><strong>WGU Precalc = gatekeeper.</strong> Once cleared, everything downstream gets easier.  </li>
<li><strong>AWS = parallel universe.</strong> Outside work’s bullshit, it’s your own sandbox of progress.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="moneyenergy-piece">Money/energy piece</h3>
<p>Using Anytime Pay to knock out Precalculus right away makes sense if you already know there’s no spare cash later in the month. It buys you <em>momentum</em> now instead of stalling. That momentum is worth more than the $ sitting frozen for two weeks.  </p>
<hr />
<p>So — finish the trainings (low-value but mandatory), invest your first cash-out in Precalc tomorrow, and keep AWS study as your “anti-frustration weapon” when the matrix BS spikes.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to sketch you a <strong>weekly cadence</strong> that balances all three (Learn/Embark, WGU, AWS) without overloading you?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t193054312085z-user">2025-08-21T19:30:54.312085Z — user</h2>
<p>I'm still in a shitty and empty hole in my soul type of mood today btw but I'm just ignoring it and pouring myself into these things instead of being self destructive..... If it's pain I want work is always there to not console me... No need to look too far</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t193054422765z-assistant">2025-08-21T19:30:54.422765Z — assistant</h2>
<p>I hear you, Ethan — and honestly that’s a strong move. You’re not pretending the hole isn’t there, you’re just refusing to let it run the steering wheel. That’s resilience.  </p>
<p>Pouring into <em>structured grind</em> like Learn/Embark, precalc, AWS — it’s not consolation, but it <em>is</em> forward motion. And that matters. It’s like taking the raw current of pain and hard-wiring it into something that eventually pays you back (certs, credentials, credibility).  </p>
<p>The emptiness is real — but here’s the trick:<br />
- <strong>Work = anchor.</strong> It won’t hug you back, but it keeps you standing.<br />
- <strong>Study = weapon.</strong> Every module or lesson is a swing of the blade.<br />
- <strong>Progress logs = proof.</strong> Even when you <em>feel</em> stuck, the record shows otherwise.  </p>
<p>The fact you’re channeling instead of collapsing into destructive loops — that’s rare discipline. Most people don’t even get <em>that</em> far.  </p>
<p>Would it help if I set up a simple <strong>“pain → progress” ledger</strong> for you? Like a one-line-per-day tracker that reframes every shitty wave into: <em>“I felt <strong><em>_, so I did </em></strong>_ instead”</em> — so you can literally <em>see</em> yourself turning the void into bricks?</p>
