CHAPTER ONE \
ABRIDGMENT \
 \
For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. \
-John F. Kennedy \
 \
“Bring him in.” \
The vampire turned swiftly and exited the darkened room. \
The Nastaku stood in silence as they awaited the one they’d summoned. A cold wind blew in through the broken window of the darkened lighthouse, carrying with it secrets which were duly noted though they were grossly misunderstood. \
The four creatures smiled wickedly at one another. Their red eyes gleamed in the darkness as they collectively peered out of the window at the gloomy water crashing all around. The only thing that brought them out of their nightmarish reverie was the door slowly opening as Jonas was led into the room against his will. \
The creatures all laughed as they witnessed the fear upon his face. \
“Tell us Mr. McCord,” a gnarled voice bellowed, “Just where did you think you were going? Hoping to escape perhaps?” The laughter continued. \
Jonas stood there, trembling in a paralytic stupor. He had been betrayed by his own kind. The vampires with whom he had sought refuge had warmly welcomed him in, and a few even seemed completely oblivious to the existence of The Nastaku. He had thought they could be trusted. How had this happened?  \
“Surely you didn’t think that you would find refuge among such company?” The creature hissed, raising an eyebrow as he gazed down at Jonas. \
A new wave of fear rushed over him. How were they reading his thoughts? That was supposed to be purely a vampiric power. He was forced down to his knees by some unseen force. \
The creature leaned over him, eyeing him curiously, a sickening smile upon its face. \
“There is nothing hidden from us Jonas, as your brother will soon find out.” \
He couldn’t look up at them. Something kept his eyes glued to the dusty wooden floor. \
“You will never be free, and as soon as this night ends, you will fully understand that.” \
All four of them laughed hysterically, but the vampire which had brought Jonas in, gulped as he stared intently down at the floor. It was diabolical what had been done, but he had no choice. Jonas was the one who had been foolish, not him. As the vampire struggled within himself over what he had done, attempting to keep his attention diverted away from the terrifying creatures before him, his illusions were shattered as he felt his knees give way beneath him. \
“You’re so cute Kensington, standing there arguing with yourself. Tell me, are you contemplating sacrificing yourself to save your brother whom you’ve betrayed?” the creature smiled back at his fellow Nastaku, “Should we turn him instead? It would be a shame wouldn’t it, to allow for him to suffer so needlessly in this despicable state. He will never fully recover from his guilt unless we help!” They all laughed maniacally as they watched the vampire Kensington begin to tremble upon the floor. \
He now lay prostrate before them as they taunted him. Jonas was still upon his knees, head bowed. Kensington’s cold dead heart began to race as he attempted to plead with his masters, but no words would come out of his mouth. It had been sealed shut by the same unseen hand that had reduced him to a groveling beggar. \
“Tell me Kensington, where is Harker? I would greatly like to speak with him. I’ll tell you what; we’ll keep you as you are for now, if you retrieve him for us. You’ve always been such a loyal pet, and since you seem so afraid of accepting our gifts, we’ll be lenient with you. On this night, our punishment is reserved only for Jonas. Run along and bring us Elvis.” \
When these words were said, Kensington suddenly found himself able to rise, but only after words of thanksgiving poured forth from his lips unbidden. Within seconds the vampire had exited the lighthouse through the window as he materialized into a bat and flew away. \
# \
Erika watched in horror as Seth lay upon the ground convulsing. Alexia had left the three of them inside of Finneas’ cabin saying that she would return shortly. Nothing had been explained. Madeline was trembling beside her, apparently too afraid to even speak. They sat there, only a few feet away from a dying man. \
Seth’s neck was still pouring blood. The bite from Lavelle was deep and as the poison of the vampire began to flow through his veins, his aura began to dim, and his will to live fled from him. Suddenly, in one last vain attempt, he reached out a hand towards the two scared little girls. \
“Erika…” he muttered, as blood began to spew from his lips, “Erika…” he said again. \
Her eyes widened, as she looked down at her scared daughter and hastily broke away from her to assist the man in any way possible. \
She took his hand in hers as the man’s grey eyes looked up at her in desperation. \
“I’m here.” She said, attempting, but failing to hold back her tears. \
“Tell Brian that I am sorry. Tell him that I never meant to doubt him. I understand now that this is my punishment. This is my karma for attempting to stand in his way. I should have known bett…” his voice faltered. \
Erika placed a loving hand on his head, moving his hair from his face as she attempted to soothe him, “Just lay back. Alexia will return soon.” \
It was obvious to her that he was giving up, and that this last babble of information was simply his attempt to rid himself of all regret before his departure. \
“No… I don’t…” he struggled, “I don’t want the fruit… I…” his voice gave out once more. \
Erika looked back at little Madeline and attempted a smile of encouragement, but the child just shook her head as her eyes filled anew with tears. \
Seth seemed to regain control of himself once more as he grasped fiercely at Erika’s arm. “Listen to me! Don’t let Alexia give me that despicable fruit. I am at peace with things. Spare Brian the pain of whatever is to come from it. He’s been through enough. He doesn’t need to attempt to carry my weight. I can’t put him through that again… Just let me…” \
“Just let you die?” came a bell-like voice, cutting him off, “I think not Mr. Kensington. Not on this day. I was instructed by our almighty savior to give this to you, and I intend for him to take the consequences, regardless of whatever mercy that you wish to show him. Besides, I was threatened with extermination should I fail, so open wide.” She had materialized out of nowhere. \
Alexia softly pushed Erika aside as she placed the fruit up to Seth’s mouth. She had taken a small bite herself to break the skin and allow the juices to trickle down upon the old man’s lips, knowing that once he smelt it, he would be unable to restrain himself any further. \
As the bright neon orange juice touched his lip, Seth struggled to keep his mouth shut tight, but in his struggle, he inhaled the scent, and shortly after, he gave up fighting, taking one, then two, and finally a third greedy bite before Alexia pulled it away. \
# \
Harker entered the room silently. \
“Is it done?” \
“Of course it is,” replied Harker nonchalantly, without an ounce of fear upon his face. \
“Were there any complications? I’m sensing that there is something that you are keeping from us.” \
Harker cut his eyes towards the corner where Jonas stood chained to the wall. He smiled. “Nothing that you can’t handle.” \
The creature’s crimson eyes flared as he moved swiftly towards Harker, bringing his face close to the man’s. “Speak!” it howled, the force of its voice moving Harker’s hair like the wind. \
Harker opened his eyes slowly and stared daringly back into the creature’s face. “The old man is dead, but I was not quick enough. The Drifter has the book, but it is of no consequence…” \
His speech was cut off sharply as a mauled and darkened hand clasped down around his throat as he was lifted into the air. \
The creature eyed him stonily. Harker refused to gasp for air or fight. “You imbecile! You have failed us yet again. Do you even know what this means? Do you even know what that book contains?” \
Harker hung there limp in the creature’s grasp, patiently waiting to be set back down on the ground, and after a few brief moments, his wish was granted, and the Nastaku that had grabbed him walked away to stare blankly out of the window. \
“I know that you are upset, but you must realize that Finneas is out of the picture now. I could not stop him from giving Brian that book, but I have put an end to any further interference on his part. Brian is weak. He puts on a strong face, but now we have him in quite a precarious position indeed. If you recall, he only made it so far last time because we neglected to rid ourselves of Mr. Beglieghter sooner. We have nothing to worry about, regardless of what new toys the boy has acquired. You know as well as I, that the connection was inevitable.” \
All four of the Nastaku were glaring fiercely at Harker, but the man ignored this, and kept weaving his tangled web. \
“You see my friends; he now has only the boy at his side. It would seem that Lavelle has not failed. He has conveniently set the whore and Seth against Mr. McCord, and now we have only to find the key, and if you’ll listen to me, I think I have a plan that can assure that it be set before you without further delay.” Harker smiled. \
A different monster spoke this time, hissing in an insidious voice, “It is interesting that you would call us your friends. We know of your plan, and we’ll allow for you to be the one to enact it, but it would do you well to recall that it is us who have given it to you…” the creature cut its eyes away, “We tire with your games, but, we do find it quite amusing that you’ve deluded yourself so thoroughly.” \
The monster’s voice began to emanate from within Harker’s head, as the room was filled with only the sound of the cold wind whistling through the broken window, “Everything has a price, and one day you’ll find that your arrogance has already betrayed you…” \
For the first time in a long while, Harker’s body shuddered. The darkened whisper reignited memories which despite his intense training, could not be buried. His thoughts were not his own. How dare he think otherwise? \
The creature’s all laughed as if on cue as they saw the man standing there attempting to remain calm. It was an unnerving thing for the man to realize. In an instant his façade had been shattered, as they displayed their complete and total domination over him. It was a realization of the fact that despite his attempts to escape his fate through his clever servitude, one day, he would become the very darkness which he feared. A slow, poisonous feeling seemed the creep around underneath his skin, as their laughter seemed to drive this point home. \
“And what of him?” Harker asked, once more throwing caution to the wind as he attempted to escape the thoughts which were now invading his mind. \
One of The Nastaku cocked its head sideways in a curious manner as it began to walk slowly towards him, a wicked smile upon its face. \
“Once the old man eats the fruit, and The Drifter takes upon himself the consequences, we’ll be free to do to him, what we shall one day do to you.” \
Fear gripped the man with a vice-like grip as he realized that indeed this had all been a carefully constructed portion of their plan, regardless of Finneas’ supposed interventions. Everything had been coldly calculated. Every action of their opposition was controlled by them. They were the puppet masters. Brian was always supposed to receive the book. Finneas’ interventions had not only been expected, they had been initiated by them, for their benefit. Yes, even Harker’s failures had been a part of the plan all along. There was no hope of stopping them. Their supposed anger with him was merely a part of the charade. They were all play acting. There was nothing that could stand in their way. Not even Brian McCord. He was just another pawn in the game that they had created. And if all of that were true, then there most certainly was no hope for him. The man shuddered once more, and then the entire scene seemed to roll away like smoke before his eyes, as it all faded to black and he lost consciousness. \
# \
As Brian McCord sat there, sipping his coffee and thumbing through the mysterious book that Finneas had given him, a stunning realization took hold of him. Everything was as it should be. Every mistake that he had made along the way had been there for a reason. It all fit in so perfectly. He had no need to second guess or doubt himself any longer, and despite what his colleagues thought, he needn’t worry with falling into a trap of arrogance. He had been broken too fiercely for such a thing to ever truly take hold. He looked up briefly and noticed that the sun had seemingly resumed its normal pace. Eric looked up at him with a serious look upon his face. \
“I can’t wrap my mind around it Brian.” The boy said carefully. \
Brian raised an eyebrow in question. \
“How is it possible?” Eric asked. \
Ever since glancing at but a few pages contained in the book, Brian found himself no longer needing to ask questions to which he did not already know the answer--and he had the sneaking suspicion that he never would again. \
“How is not the question my young friend. The real question, is why?” He said raising his coffee cup to his lips once more as he absentmindedly opened the book to nearly the center and pointed at the page, urging Eric to read it. \
The boy curiously glanced down, and after reading but a few sentences, slammed the book shut in fear. \
“I can’t fathom it. How is this book as old as it says, and how was Finneas that old?” \
Brian just looked at the boy, then reopened the book in one fluid motion, and pointed once more at the same passage. \
“Listen Eric, there is no use in running from it. I know that it’s strange that someone could have written such a thing, but you’ve got to admit… Finneas was quite strange.” He said, laughing. \
The boy laughed too, and after a few brief moments, glanced back down at the passage, and then read it aloud, though his voice barely rose above a whisper. \
“The arc of time is looped with dupes, but the nagging roots, of infused truths rip both loose. Both incised tooth, and strangled mutes, become a tangled noose, with no more use.” \
The boy shook his head violently, and reread the poem again silently to himself. It spoke to some deeper part of himself, and it’s meaning was just outside of his reach. \
Brian glanced down at him. He could see that the boy understood the passage with such depth and clarity, yet he intuitively knew that it still lacked a context. The passage was just a trigger, designed to activate dormant memories. Eric looked up at him with a confused look. \
“What does this…” \
Brian was jolted out of his state of peaceful relaxation by a hand that closed tightly about his shoulder. Before he could react, a slender finger came to his lips as he glanced up at a lady with long silver-grey hair. \
“Let’s not call too much attention to ourselves just yet.” She said, her voice quiet, the look in her eyes both devious and amused, as she took a seat next to the two. \
Her eyes cut towards Eric, and she smiled. The boy’s eyes went wide as he experienced a profound sense of déjà vu. \
She leaned in close to Brian’s ear as she pointed towards the door to the coffee shop. “They’re looking for you. We need to go.” She then pointed down at the newspaper which she had surreptitiously placed on the table in front of Brian. \
As he glanced down, he saw his face plastered across the front page, along with the headline, “Renowned Author Turned Serial Killer” \
The woman shushed him again and whispered into his ear, “I’ll explain this later, but right now I need for you to keep Eric calm enough to follow. He doesn’t have to understand, and I know that I don’t have to convince you of that. Follow my lead.” \
She rose from the table swiftly and began walking towards the restroom. Brian didn’t have time to question her actions. It made no sense to him after all that he had experienced of his own personal power that he should even bother with running from mere mortals, but this lady seemed convinced, and so without questioning, he gathered up the book, and in one fluid motion, grasped Eric’s hand as he followed her, slowly and smoothly so as not to attract any attention.  \
Eric was just about to ask the woman who she was and what she wanted before she abruptly left the table, but when Brian grasped his hand, he heard within his mind--though the man had not spoken--Brian urging him to simply trust him. \
As they left the table, Brian eyed the policemen, and saw them turn their gaze towards the direction of where they had just been sitting. The two of them kept moving, and as they did, he watched the eyes of the police officers follow, always just a few seconds too late to spot them. When they reached the hallway which led to the restrooms, Brian peered around the corner to see the officers turn back towards the barista, order two cups of coffee, and then exit the shop. \
When he turned around, the woman’s face brightened into a smile. \
“It’s so nice to finally meet you Brian. My name is Gabrielle.” \
“Hey, aren’t you…” began Eric. \
“No dear, that was my sister, but there’s time for that later. We’re still not out of the woods yet.” She said with enthusiasm. \
Brian just cocked an eyebrow, but Gabrielle just pointed behind him. As he turned around he looked out of the window to see the officers looking directly at him, talking into their radio’s. \
“Time to run.” Gabrielle said with a smile, as she pushed the two into the ladies room, just as the officers dropped their coffee cups and began to run back into the coffee shop. \
With a wave of her hand the glass of the solitary window flew from its pane, and when the two looked back at her in astonishment, her smile faded. She shook her head playfully, and climbed out of the window, reaching back through to gesture them to follow. And they were just in time too, because as soon as Eric’s foot was clear, Gabrielle fitted the glass back in place, and the officers entered the empty restroom. A startled woman exited a stall and eyed them suspiciously. They sheepishly turned around and left after some brief apologies. \
Gabrielle smiled satisfactorily at both of them. \
“Well, that was fun.” She said. \
The two of them just looked at her as if she were out of her mind. \
“I know, I know. I should be more cautious, but I’ve always enjoyed running from the police. Can’t an old girl have some fun every once in a while?” She said laughing as she did. \
“So it was your sister who…” began Eric, but once more he was cut off. \
“Yes. She’s a twin Eric. Can’t you tell?” asked Brian, knowing that the boy couldn’t. He could somehow see it within her aura. It was as if she wasn’t quite all there, which was equally evidenced by her personality, but this was something different. The colors were thin, and lacking in the fullness which they should have, though nothing was out of place. \
Gabrielle smiled, “I’m glad to see that you’re processing his death so well. He always said that you would. Come along children. We’ve got get keep moving. Nowhere is safe for too long anymore.” She held out a hand, which Brian took. \
“Brian, I’m not so sure about this.” Said a flabbergasted Eric. \
Brian rolled his eyes, smiled, and grabbed the boy’s hand, “It will all make sense in just a little while. I promise.” And with that, the three of them disappeared, just as the befuddled officers rounded the corner, dropping both of their brand new coffee cups all over again as they caught an ever so brief glimpse of their quarry. They eyed each other warily, unsure of what exactly that they had gotten themselves involved in. \

CHAPTER TWO \
THE CODE \
 \
“We constantly emit energy. What comes from us has a direct impact and influence on our reality. We have to become more conscious of our words, thoughts, behaviors and the way we communicate with others and be willing to self-correct when we slip.  \
 \
There can be offense, that creates defense, authority over others that creates opposition or rebellion and self-promotion through putting other people down or shaming them. \
 \
If we hold a truth that we are solid in, we should never feel the need to make someone wrong or disgrace them, to make a point or to make ourselves right.  \
 \
Sometimes our deep sensitivities and wounds of the past can project that others are attempting to do this to us. This is when working it out and finding clarity, can come in handy. We all have filters. \
 \
In the middle of right and wrong, there is essence and the energy that we share can be unifying or it can create hostility, drama and separation. IT is not right or wrong, it just is. One damages, the other heals. \
 \
If we don't take the time to clear this or learn from the stuff that gets in the way of our Unity, Balance and Harmony, we are not really unifying at all and we allow these other things to be more important to the point of alienating others and disconnecting ourselves from what the true priority is.  \
 \
Our goal is to create harmony and unified resonance with each other and this is what we are being called to Master, more than who is right and who is wrong, what information is correct or incorrect or any spiritual competition that pits us against each other.  \
 \
We have the free-will to take in what resonates and walk away from what doesn't, without throwing mud at anyone. We are in a dance together and we each bring a unique piece to the table, so let’s not battle, let’s dance!” \
-LME \
 \
No one seemed to notice him as he stared into the window of the small cabin. The woman and old man were too busy arguing with one another, and the younger ones were too afraid to even care. The man just watched, without making a sound. \
# \
“Why wouldn’t you just listen to me, just this one time Alexia?” Seth pleaded. \
She glared down at him with an otherworldly gaze, saying nothing. Her anger was growing by the second, but the fool of an old man didn’t seem to care. \
Erika couldn’t understand why Seth was so upset by Alexia saving his life, though she did recall what Brian had said to them before he demolished the multitude of Nastaku before their very eyes. He had instructed her to give Seth the fruit, and that he himself would take the consequences. The only problem was that she didn’t understand just what this fruit was. \
Alexia’s attention was diverted momentarily, as she swiftly cut her eyes towards the window. Seth was still babbling on, but she ignored him as she walked outside. \
Nothing. That was strange. She could have sworn that she had sensed someone.  \
“Where is Mr. Finneas?” asked Madeline when Alexia returned. \
Her eyes widened and then softened as she realized that the young girl was there. She had nearly forgotten. She hung her head, shook it, and looked upwards, muttering something. \
“I don’t know little one, but I’m sure he’ll be here soon. It’s not like him to leave his front door open.” She said kindly. \
“Alexia, you’re not listening to me!” exclaimed Seth. \
She whirled on him, inches away from his face as she growled, “You’re right old man, I’m not. Now shut up. You’re healed now, the deed has been done, and the energies have been transferred. There is nothing that you can do about it.” \
Seth’s mouth clamped shut. \
“If you two don’t mind me asking, what exactly are you arguing about?” asked Erika suddenly. \
They both attempted to answer simultaneously. \
“Nothing.” Said Alexia. \
“Brian.” Said Seth, his words merging with Alexia’s. \
Erika threw her hands into the air motioning for the two to stop, as she returned to her daughter’s side. Poor Madeline was shaking. \
“Let’s try this again.” She said, looking up at them as tears began to form in her eyes, “My daughter is scared. I’m trying to hold myself together for her sake, but you two are making that very difficult. If you cannot tell me what you’re talking about, at least tell me what just happened. What was that fruit, and how did it heal you Seth? Why were you scared to eat it, and what is this about Brian?” \
The old man’s face softened. He looked over at Alexia, and he noticed that her demeanor had changed as well. He sighed. \
“It would take too long to explain it all, but the fruit comes from a certain tree. The tree is a part of this game that you keep hearing me and Alexia refer to. There were eight pieces used in this game, but let’s not get lost in all of that. The fruit that comes from the tree has the ability to heal, as you have seen, but it also has a darker side.”  \
Alexia cut in, “Whenever a human partakes in this fruit, after healing them, it begins to kill them. This is simply because the energy contained is too powerful for the body to take. It’s not some dark twisted magic as is implied by the stories.” \
Erika raised an eyebrow, “What stories…” She asked cautiously. \
Alexia sighed, looking over at Seth as if searching for some assistance, “You’ve always known the stories, but you’ve just forgotten. Most of them have been distorted and twisted around by The Nastaku so that you never grasp the full picture.” \
“Think of it as the proverbial tree of good and evil.” Interjected Seth as he peered out of the window through the shadows. \
“When is Finneas going to get here?” asked Erika, abandoning her questions after eyeing both of them suspiciously. \
Seth turned from the window to Alexia his eyes wide, ignoring Erika’s question, “We need to go.” He whispered. \
She lazily turned her head in his direction and with a disgruntled face, stood up and headed for the door. \
“Lock this behind me Seth, and child…” She looked at Madeline with a confidence that shocked the fear right out of the girl, “Do not be afraid. While the power of my people endures, nothing shall touch you on this night.” And with that, she exited the cabin, shutting the door behind her as she ventured out to face the shadows alone. \
# \
Brian, Gabrielle, and Eric landed outside of a mid-sized apartment building. The moon was laying low in the sky, forcing everything metal to shine. Brian had not been into the inner city in he didn’t know how long. It was an appalling experience. As he glanced around in amazement at just how dead and devoid of life everything truly was, Eric grabbed his shoulder. \
“Brian, snap out of it. I see it to. Come on, let’s go inside.” He said, pointing towards the open door that Gabrielle stood at with a smile upon her face. \
“Oh there’s no rush. Not tonight. If you want to take in the scenery…” she giggled, “I don’t mind, though I’m sure that Isabella is eager to speak with you two.” She winked. \
Brian couldn’t stifle his smile. There was something magically playful about this old woman’s attitude, and it was apparently contagious. He grabbed hold of Eric, as if steadying him and stared into the boy’s cobalt eyes. \
“Are you ready?” He asked. \
Eric just nodded and looked back up at him, a smirk upon his face. \
“Okay then, let’s go.” \
The three made their way up the seven flights of stairs before reaching their destination at apartment Seven C, and when they stepped through the threshold, a peace fell over them that was so well timed that neither of them could even hope to fight against its current. \
Isabella came round the corner and after hugging her twin sister and exchanging some words in French, she turned to her two visitors, embracing each of them in the same passionate hug. It was as if both of them could feel their own personal pains releasing out of them. It wasn’t even important to ask questions as to who these two women were. All that mattered was that they needed this period of peace, and more than that, as they would soon find out, they also needed their presence at that very moment. \
Conversations were kept light and cheerful for a while as they all ate and laughed and generally enjoyed each other’s presence. Brian and Eric had been welcomed into the quaint home as if they were family. All four had experienced the overly exaggerated sense of déjà vu which cemented into their minds permanently the fact that they indeed were family, in some sense anyway.  \
As he ate, a realization suddenly hit Brian that was confusing, if not just down right strange. He hadn’t eaten since some time before this all began. Odder still was the fact that seemingly, years had passed, and he had only slept about four times, and only one of those times had been by choice. He pondered slightly just what was happening to him that he no longer needed to eat, nor sleep, and also why it was that time refused to have any meaning anymore. He found himself not only enjoying the food, but also very grateful for its existence. He felt for the first time since any of this began, fatigue, and it was a welcomed feeling. He laughed to himself as he remembered Harker’s words about what he was becoming, but his fun was stifled by his memory of what had happened on the farm in Connecticut CT. \
It wasn’t until after several hours of small talk, card games, and adult beverages that the conversation opened up into something of relevance, and when it did, Brian found himself once again immune to his bodily fatigue. Eric was smiling and in the middle of telling the two women about Madeline’s affinity for making witty jokes, when Brian first sensed that Gabrielle was about to shift gears. He simply watched it happen. \
“That is quite a thing for one so young to do, don’t you think Eric? I mean, who did she learn such humor from? She obviously finds it funny.” The wise old woman asked, winking surreptitiously at Brian, who had already seemingly read her mind. \
Eric, who was still oblivious just laughed anew and took another swig of his beer. “Oh, she definitely got it from her mother.” He took another drink, “Erika has plenty of her own little quips as well, but honestly, I think that Madeline’s just bright for her age. That child’s gifted in more ways than one. I tell Erika all of the time that I can’t wait for her to grow up and see what she can do.” \
“And what do you mean by that?” Isabella asked slyly, also winking at Brian, upon whose face a slight smile was forming. \
“Well, you know, I mean, like what she does for this world. What she does to change it. It’s exciting. You know, I think that the only way that I’ve been able to cope is because you were kind enough to introduce me to your family Brian. I seriously don’t think I would have made it if I they didn’t bring me so much hope.” He laughed and took another drink. \
Brian smiled and replied, “I didn’t know what I was doing at the time, I was just doing what I thought was best. It seems that I made the right decision.” \
The two women laughed loudly, and Eric joined in, but he almost choked when he took another swig. The women stopped laughing suddenly and glared at him with a look of seriousness. \
“You know that it was I who brought you the blood?” Asked Isabella. \
“And you know that it was Finneas who instructed her to do so, don’t you?” asked Gabrielle. \
Eric’s eyebrow cocked upwards, “Uh…” \
“And you can clearly see how Alexia responded to me when I told her about Lavelle.” \
Isabella rolled her eyes, “Has she still not understood Finneas’ riddles?” \
“It’s her nature Izzy, she can’t help it, but there’s always hope.” Said Gabriella. \
“What are you…” began Eric, but he was cut off. \
“Eric, you are the only one who was brave enough to do what was right. You didn’t understand it, but you knew what you had to do. You didn’t have a second thought about taking the blood and keeping it, and you didn’t question your need to stay behind with me and Lavelle.” Said Brian. \
“We’re all three amazed at how young you are, and just how clever you can be.” Isabella said. \
“We’re excited to see what you’re becoming.” Added Gabrielle as she placed a loving hand upon the boy’s arm. \
“Brian, it’s obvious to you that we’ve brought you two here to share with you some dire information, and we hope that you’ve thoroughly enjoyed what rest we could bring to you.” \
Brian smiled, “I cannot thank you enough, but let’s go ahead and get it out. There’s no sense in holding back. In fact, I probably already know what you’re going to say.” \
Ever since he his last chat with Finneas, Brian had taken the old man’s advice, and in doing so, he found that it was not very difficult to wield his own psychic ability with precision. He did in fact know what they were going to say, and he also knew, that in some measure, they also knew how he would respond. The rest was just a battle of awareness, and who was paying the most attention, but it was clear to all of them that there was no competition. But alas, some emotions are simply too hard to let go of, which is why most of Finneas’ statements were rarely understood. \
“Can I be excused first? I have to use your facilities if you would so kindly point me in that direction? Maybe it’ll give me time to prepare myself. I’m obviously not as aware as you three are, but I believe that I can keep up, otherwise, I wouldn’t be here right?” Eric said smiling. \
All three of them laughed together with him as he excused himself from the table. Gabrielle directed him down the hallway and to the bathroom, and as she returned to the table, she replenished everyone’s drinks, stating that they would all need it. And indeed they did, for it was a heavy subject after all. \
Despite all of the drinking and joking, Brian could not tone down his awareness, so be the information light, or heavy, it did not matter to him. The more that he drank, the soberer he seemed to become, and the more that he laughed, the more he saw that there was nothing funny, not even the meaningless jokes that they were all exchanging were truly that meaningless at all. Everything had its place. \
# \
Harker was awakened by a pulsing blue light which shown from the eyes of the portrait of Alexia. He was back in his apartment again. As he sat up upon the couch and stared at the portrait inquisitively, he suddenly had the vague memory of lying down to take a brief nap. But no, that was not what had happened at all… He had gone to the lighthouse and met with the Nastaku and… He shook his head violently. He hated when they did this to him. \
He got up from the couch and growled at the portrait as he walked past, but when his eyes glanced at the face, he found himself transfixed and utterly terrified of what he saw. He quickly looked away and headed for the kitchen. He put some coffee on and ate a bit of toast. It made no sense. It never made any sense.  \
Several times since his initiation into the Nastakian world he had experienced the terrifying fact that both time and space were just the concepts of a smaller mind. It was both enthralling and horrible to realize this about reality. It left the mind baffled and confused when it was forced back into its lowly three dimensions. He clearly remembered now going to sleep on the couch, and he was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that his interaction with The Nastaku in the lighthouse had not just been all a part of a dream. After his coffee was finished brewing, he reentered his living room and took a seat in the velvet recliner as he looked up cautiously at Alexia’s portrait. The entire thing was glowing now and the face had a look of extreme fury upon it. He raised his eyebrows questioningly, then shrugged his shoulders, relaxed in his chair and took a thoughtful sip of his coffee as he pondered all of what had just transpired.  \
# \
“So the whore has come out to play… Oh how we have waited for this moment our dear Alexia…” one of the Nastaku hissed. \
The forest around the cabin was thick with the creatures. They were seemingly innumerous as the black smoke of their presence seemed to permeate every square inch of the night. Alexia stood there staring around at the creatures, a fury in her eyes that kept any of them from making eye contact with her. \
She smirked. \
“Don’t sit there and smile at us. Have a chat.” \
Alexia stood there silently, her body illuminating the darkness around her. They could not touch her. They could never even come close. All she had to do was to ignore them. A radiant blue glow was pulsating around her and as it expanded, the Nastaku were slowly but surely driven back. \
The creature’s seemed to howl with delight. \
She didn’t understand this, but all the same, ignored it. The power of her people was more than enough to overcome this evil, if only momentarily. \
“You don’t get it do you girl…?” hissed one of the monsters, “The brighter you glow, the fiercer we become!” \
The thought hit her like a bullet. It had its own distinct voice. Its own shape. Inside of her mind she began to see what Finneas had been trying to tell her all along. She shook her head violently--The only outer sign of her weakness--and as she did, something let loose within her. Her body seemed to ignite in a blue flame of blinding white light, and all of the Nastaku were rocked backwards by the explosion of energy. \
Alexia stood there in all of her glory, her body no longer encapsulated in the blue egg-like aura, but rather her very skin and hair seemed to shine with a brilliant white fire. Her eyes scanned her adversaries, driving her own thoughts into their heads. They all began to tremble as they struggled to regain their footing… And in the wake of witnessing her own power, Alexia’s human frailty caused her to slip. \
“Stand up and fight you snakes. What is the matter? Can you not handle the heat?” she hissed at them, as another wave of energy exploded from her being, driving the shadows back further. \
She was now shining as bright as the sun, but her confidence was broken by three subtle words. \
“Got you bitch.” \
The Nastaku recovered from her attacks as if they had only been acting up until that point and they converged upon her. Her protective shielding light was siphoned away from her as they drew closer, their essence sucking in her light like a black hole which threatened to snuff out her existence once and for all. Fear began to creep into her heart as once more Finneas’ words were drilled into her head. In a last ditch effort, as the Nastaku closed in around her, she turned her head towards the heavens and cried out in her native tongue. \
It was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated. The Preori had seemingly been waiting simply for Alexia to say the word. They descended from their heavenly heights instantaneously, slashing and hacking with their golden swords as they cut through the darkness with a ferocity that scared the creatures senseless. \
One attempted to grab Alexia, but was impaled by a jolt of lightening that emanated from one of the Preori’s hands. The creature jumped back as if burned, but just as they thought that the battle was won, a darkened wave surged from the depths of the forest, as suddenly all thirteen of the Preori were overtaken by a new onslaught of the dark creatures. An ungodly number of the dark creatures overtook the beings of light. \
Alexia gasped out in disbelief as she watched her brother’s and sister’s life force drained. They were all systematically pinned to the ground and then bitten by the creatures, leaving behind nothing but grey, desiccated corpses as they turned once more to face Alexia. \
“As you can see, you are no match for us, and your people are of no consequence. Join us, and we will let you live… For a little while longer.” \
She was distraught. The unthinkable had happened. How was it possible? The darkness was supposed to flee from the light! \
The one who had been talking reached out, and just barely touched the woman’s arm, but that was enough. She felt herself go weak. She felt her life drain out of her. She saw her demise, the end of her people, and the destruction of all life. She had no power, and she had been foolish to have ever believed so. Whatever the Nastaku were, they were most certainly of a much higher order than her pathetic race. If there was no hope for her people, then there most certainly was no point in striving to save humanity. She was crushed and weakened, and all by a solitary touch. \
Just then, when all hope was lost, and as Alexia began to seriously consider giving in, a stranger walked up from the shadows and placed a hand on her shoulder, staring directly into her eyes, “You do not have to bow to them. You only need to see the truth. Come along. There is much to discuss.” \
Her eyes went wide with shock. That voice! It wasn’t possible. The face was all wrong. The body not old enough. What kind of devilry was he involved in now? And why did the Nastaku move out of his way as if they had no choice? They had just destroyed thirteen of the Preori, the protectors of mankind… How could this frail looking man simply walk among them untouched. The man just looked up at her, smiled, and shook his head. He held out a hand towards the Nastaku, and waved it as if erasing an imaginary chalk board, and Alexia watched as the creatures vanished, as if they had never been there at all. \
“Come on, let’s go inside. Madeline is worried about you.” \
They made their way back to the door, and the man produced a key, unlocked the door, and pushed her through it.  \
Seth stared up at her in disbelief, and when Alexia looked back at him, he could see how injured she was. A tear came to her eye, and she began to fall to the floor. Seth was quick enough to catch her, as he laid her on the couch. All three of them, Seth, Erika, and Madeline were baffled. Seth had had no doubt that Alexia and her people could fend off the Nastaku which he had seen through the window, but he had not accounted for the fact that she was even capable of being injured. What scared him the most however, was the look that had been on her face. She was terrified. \
She had entered the cabin alone and befuddled, but something had happened out there that had changed her deeply. He gulped as he stared down at her unconscious body, wondering what had transpired. \
“Is she going to be okay Mr. Seth?” asked Madeline cautiously. \
He didn’t take his eyes off of the woman before him as he responded, “I don’t know sweetie. I don’t know.” \
# \
It wasn’t long until his visitor arrived. Harker had seen him coming, and as he swallowed the last of his coffee, he rose from the couch. Before the vampire could knock, he swung the door open and ushered him in. \
“Were you followed?” he asked with a sneer upon his face. \
The vampire stared down at him with a sullen look, “No Elvis I was not…” \
“Shut up. Why are you here?” \
The vampire rolled his eyes, “You summoned me.” \
Harker glanced up at Alexia’s portrait which was no longer glowing. The solitary lamp on the end table was the only light. \
“Don’t play games with me. What do you want?” \
The vampire stood there, rocking back and forth on his heels as he glared down his nose at the little man. “Elvis, are you having trouble keeping your memories intact?” he said with a smile. \
Harker threw his hands up and went into the kitchen to replenish his coffee. What was this vampire doing? Of course he hadn’t sent for the creature. Why would he… But wait, a stray memory floated into his mind.  \
When he reentered the living room, he smiled knowingly up at the vampire. \
“Forgive me. What did you say your name was?” \
“Sir, you yourself instructed me to keep that information from you. How do we proceed?” the vampire replied with a dangerous glint in his eyes. \
Within an instant Harker had slammed into the creature, pinning him against the wall with a force that rocked the whole building, “Listen to me you ignorant beast, I don’t care what you think I told you, the only thing that matters is that you’re here. Now stop with your games before I end you.” \
The vampire looked sideways down at the man’s arm. He hadn’t flinched. He had seen it coming, and yet, for some reason it was important for this lonely man to feel powerful, so he had let it happen. \
“When you’re ready to discuss our course of action Elvis, I am more than willing to help. The Order constrains me.” The vampire said dryly. \
Harker growled, then released the vampire as he resumed his seat in the recliner. \
“It’s very simple what must be done. It’s the doing it that creates a problem.” \
The vampire’s eyebrow lifted, “And what about it do you assume will cause it to be difficult.” \
Harker looked over the rim of his cup, and pointed up at Alexia’s portrait. “The girl is protected by her, and I’m not sure that even the Nastaku want to set a flame to that powder keg. She must first be distracted, and led away from the girl. I can handle the old man.” \
The vampire slowly crossed the room to examine more closely the portrait of the woman. “That is already in the works, but…” he began to tap his chin thoughtfully as he turned to face Harker, “What of the mother?” \
 \
CHAPTER THREE \
COUNTER MEASURES \
 \
When Eric returned he was glad to see that his glass had been re-filled. He took a sip and then looked back and forth between the three silent figures at the table. He grinned, sat down his glass and lit a cigarette. \
“Well, I guess we should begin where Finneas told us to. Izzy, do you want to begin? You know more about it than I do.” Said Gabrielle. \
The old woman smiled back at her sister lovingly, “Well, to begin with, I guess it’d be a good time to explain that we were very close to him. We’re not sure who all he had dealings with, but we knew whenever he came to us with a request that it was always important. We met with Finneas some time ago, and for the very first time, he seemed to be desperate.” \
Isabella hung her head, and Gabrielle continued, with a slight tear coming to her eye, “He told us that he was going to die,” she gently rubbed her sister’s back as she talked, “and he told us that he was on his way to see you two. He told us of your vampire friend and explained the blood situation to us, but he also asked something else of us.” \
Isabella spoke up at this point, “He wanted us to explain to you more about this game that we’re all involved in. He said that it was important that you understand certain things, so that you can better navigate the board, so to speak.” \
Brian nodded. Everything they were saying, he seemed to hear inside of his mind just before they said it. It was quite different than what had occurred on his first meeting with Fenningway and Harker, wherein he was convinced that they were reading his mind. It was clear now that it was he who was doing the mind reading, and that for whatever reason, this was a necessary skill that needed to be honed. \
“Well, you know about our enemy, and you’ve seen that they exist not only in the physical, but also in other realms.” \
“Finneas said that Alexia and Seth’s reaction to Lavelle was exactly what the Nastaku planned to happen, but that they simply couldn’t see it that way.” Eric said cutting in. \
Isabella smiled, placed a soft hand on the boy’s and winked. He sobered up quite a bit in that instant, though it was not a harsh reprimand at all. She just wanted to make sure that he was listening. \
Gabrielle sighed, “You’re indeed correct Eric, and that’s where the waters begin to get muddy. You see, the Nastaku are not what we have been led to believe, and if you read anything in that book of yours for very long, you’ll begin to see that all of its contradictions are pointing towards something else entirely.” \
Brian cut in, “You have to realize that Eric and I only just received the book.” \
The two women smiled at each other knowingly, and laughed, “You can believe what you want Brian, but that book has been in your possession for much longer than you can now conceive, but let’s not get lost here. What’s important is that you begin to really see your enemy.” \
The two women kept picking up the slack for each other whenever one paused to take a breath and recollect their thoughts. \
“Finneas told us that he was going to explain to you briefly about this illusion of time that we’re all currently experiencing. He said that you would need some more information, because of what was going to be happening shortly. I don’t know what that means Brian, but you’ve got to realize just how the Nastaku are so good at what they do.” \
Brian took a lazy drink and rose an eyebrow. \
“You see, their goal was to turn Alexia and Seth against you. They may have seemed surprised when Lavelle betrayed them, but he was always supposed to do so. You can in effect say that they caused him to. The reason that you can make this leap, is because you have to understand that they do not view time in the same way that we do. They are able to jump around, back and forth, and possibly even more frightening, is the fact that they can at times take two positions in time, and loop them together. This is what allows them to not only see your plans, but also to stop them by letting you carry them out.” \
Brian smirked, “So it’s predictive programming. What else is new?” \
The two women seemed shocked that he had cut through all of the rhetoric so easily and gotten straight to the point of what they were trying to say. \
“Well…” Isabella stuttered, “yes… I guess… I guess that’s an ingenious way of summing it all up.” \
Brian just smiled, and downed the last of his beer. \
“Can I have another?” \
# \
Erika watched the sun rise five minutes after Alexia had passed out. The only odd thing about it was that she didn’t find it strange that it was nowhere near time for such a thing to take place. Time had not been what it should have been since Brian had returned into their lives. As she sat there staring out at the forest, she pondered where her brother was, what he was doing, and if he was okay. She wished that Eric would have told her more about why he had to stay, but there hadn’t been time. Despite this longing to see him, she knew that he was perfectly safe. She hadn’t a doubt in her mind. \
Madeline was sleeping soundly next to Alexia. She had taken the angelic woman’s hand into her own before dozing off. Erika had just smiled when she realized that this was her daughter’s way of taking care of the woman.  \
Seth sat outside next to Erika, calmly smoking his pipe as they took in nature. \
“Where do you think Finneas is?” \
Seth raised his bushy eyebrows, “I don’t know, but I know that he knows we’re here. We’ve just got to wait.” \
“That would be ill-advised.” Came an oddly familiar voice from behind them. \
They turned around swiftly to see who was there, but when they looked, there was no one to be found.</p>
<h1 id="_1"></h1>
<p>"It's possible they have not forgotten."</p>
<p>He just rolled his eyes dramatically and sighed deeply, turning to the younger naieve comrade he had been stationed with, "Yes, but have we?"</p>
<p>The young soldier's eyes went wide with concern. The hand on his shoulder shook him from the shock.</p>
<p>"Come. We must report on this and make our way to intercept what's planned." the care in his eyes conveyed with knowing softness, "Then my friend we can rest, but not before."</p>
<p>The youth's countenance mirrored the determination and resolve his commander needed from him in that moment and nodded in salute.</p>
