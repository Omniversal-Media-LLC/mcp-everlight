<p>This document is a <strong>“Cancellation of Deed to Secure Debt”</strong>, which essentially means the mortgage tied to a particular property has been <strong>paid in full</strong> and the lien is officially released.</p>
<h3 id="heres-a-breakdown-of-what-it-all-means">Here's a breakdown of what it all means:</h3>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-details">📍 <strong>Key Details:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property Location:</strong> 5999 Friendship Church Rd, Bartow, GA 30413 (Jefferson County)</li>
<li><strong>Borrowers:</strong> Roland R. Womack Jr. and Faye I. Womack</li>
<li><strong>Lender:</strong> Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</li>
<li><strong>Original Mortgage Date:</strong> October 1, 2007</li>
<li><strong>Loan Number:</strong> 0171744949</li>
<li><strong>Deed Book &amp; Page:</strong> Book 429, Page 193 (the original recording location of the mortgage)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-this-document-means">✅ <strong>What This Document Means:</strong></h3>
<p>This form is a <strong>legal acknowledgment by Wells Fargo</strong> that the mortgage loan tied to this property was <strong>fully paid off</strong> as of <strong>July 25, 2018</strong>, and the <strong>lien is canceled</strong>. That means the bank no longer holds a claim against the property due to that loan.</p>
<p>This is important because once a loan is paid off, the lien must be formally canceled with the county recorder’s office (in this case, <strong>Jefferson County, GA</strong>), which this document does.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-does-it-say-florida">🏛️ <strong>Why Does It Say Florida?</strong></h3>
<p>The notary and signer (Jessica Reaves, Vice President of Loan Documentation) executed the cancellation in <strong>Florida</strong> because:
- Wells Fargo Home Mortgage uses a <strong>processing center located in Palm Harbor, FL</strong> (this is where document clearing is done).
- The <strong>notary public and corporate officer are based in Florida</strong>, even though the property is in Georgia.
- The document is <strong>filed with the Georgia Clerk of Court</strong> after being notarized in Florida — this is normal for national banks.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="timeline-highlights">🗓️ Timeline Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mortgage paid in full:</strong> July 25, 2018</li>
<li><strong>Document notarized in Florida:</strong> July 25, 2018</li>
<li><strong>Filed with Clerk of Court in Jefferson County, GA:</strong> July 31, 2018 at 8:00 AM</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If this cancellation was issued right before the purchase of a new property, it would suggest the Womacks sold or refinanced this one and used the proceeds to pay off the mortgage — and then moved or restructured ownership (which aligns with the Orchard Way property timeline you've mentioned before).</p>
<p>Let me know if you want this entered into a timeline or case file.</p>
