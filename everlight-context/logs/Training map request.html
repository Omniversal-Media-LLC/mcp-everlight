<p>User is referencing a detailed badge and recognition dashboard on an internal Amazon system that shows participation in numerous launches, initiatives, programs, and award campaigns. They are requesting a training map related to these badges and appear to be working under or collaborating with Erik Hanssen, Director of WHS Programs (hanssen@amazon.com).</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-25t111658750581z-assistant">2025-07-25T11:16:58.750581Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Understood. The badges displayed span a wide range of Amazon initiatives—including program launches, beta tests, WHS campaigns, software rollouts, and cross-functional achievements. To build or request the <strong>training map</strong> associated with these badges, we’ll need to align each badge to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Program or Initiative Name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Date/Year of Launch</strong></li>
<li><strong>Department or Org Unit (e.g., WHS, RME, Ops, PrimeNow)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Training Requirements or Courses Linked</strong></li>
<li><strong>Skillsets or Competencies Gained</strong></li>
<li><strong>Manager/Sponsor (if known)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Internal Link or Portal Access</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Would you like me to start constructing a spreadsheet format for this (CSV or Excel), or draft a request email to Hanssen asking for the official internal training map if it already exists?</p>

<p>Red Rimmed blue badge</p>

<p>Got it. The phrase <strong>“Red Rimmed Blue Badge”</strong> likely refers to a specific type of Amazon internal recognition badge—one that visually distinguishes certain employees who have either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed specialized training (WHS, RME, Safety, or PMO-aligned)</li>
<li>Participated in a restricted-access or confidential initiative</li>
<li>Operate under dual-role or hybrid-clearance functions (common in cross-functional programs)</li>
<li>Received elevated access or observer-level privileges tied to systemic deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be symbolic or literal—some badges in Amazon's ecosystem are visual-only (UI elements), while others correspond to <strong>functional permissions</strong> (like elevated Coupa, OpsLive, Midway, or VPN access).</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Confirm What It Unlocks</strong><br />
   Check what extra dashboards, tools, or Slack channels are available when logged in under the blue badge with the red rim. If your Coupa, Midway, or Travel profiles behave differently, that’s a sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Badge Mapping Inclusion</strong><br />
   Would you like me to label this “Red Rimmed Blue Badge” as a key <strong>access node</strong> or <strong>symbolic designation</strong> in your training map?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Reference Query</strong><br />
   If you're prepping for a message to Hanssen or a PMO leader, I can include a line like:<br />
<em>"Please confirm whether the Red-Rimmed Blue Badge correlates with a specific clearance level or operational tier within WHS Program initiatives or PMO-tracked training rollouts."</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Shall I proceed with that draft or drop it into the training schema scaffold?</p>

<p>If you can give us a training map for this and we'll make another branch in our repo for whs personelle and Incorporate it as a secondary priority pathing on our curriculum </p>

<p>Here’s what I can piece together based on publicly available info:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="red-rimmed-blue-badge-explained">🔹 “Red-Rimmed Blue Badge” Explained</h2>
<p>At Amazon, badge colors and rims often indicate <strong>tenure-based recognition</strong> rather than functional access:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue badge (solid)</strong> is the standard for full-time, permanent employees. citeturn0search0turn0search2turn0search1  </li>
<li>A <strong>colored rim</strong> represents years of service:</li>
<li><strong>Orange rim</strong> = 5 years</li>
<li><strong>Red rim</strong> = 10 years</li>
<li><strong>Purple rim</strong> = 15 years</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Grey rim</strong> = 20 years citeturn0search2turn0search1</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, a <strong>blue badge with a red rim</strong> typically indicates a permanent employee with ~10 years of tenure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="training-map-structure-for-whs-personnel-track">🚀 Training Map Structure for WHS Personnel Track</h2>
<p>That means this is likely a <strong>recognition-level cue</strong>, not a functional badge connected to access or training. But it still can play a part in your training curriculum roadmap:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Badge Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Base Badge (Blue)</strong></td>
<td>Permanent/Full-Time Employee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tenure Rim (Red)</strong></td>
<td>10‑year service milestone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Training Tie-In</strong></td>
<td>Likely associated with advanced WHS training, leadership, and cross-functional updates, aligned with 10‑yr milestones.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr />
<h3 id="proposed-training-map-integration">✅ Proposed Training Map Integration</h3>
<p>To build a training map in your repo for WHS personnel that includes this badge:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify training milestones</strong> aligned with each badge rim tier (e.g. 5‑yr, 10‑yr, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Secondary-path curriculum</strong>: Create a “veteran track” pathway for personnel at the 10‑yr mark—include leadership, safety mastery, coaching, compliance deep dives.</li>
<li><strong>Branch naming and structure</strong>: e.g.,  </li>
<li><strong><code>whs-veteran-track</code></strong> branch  <ul>
<li><code>10yr/leadership</code></li>
<li><code>10yr/safety‑audit</code></li>
<li><code>10yr/access‑scanner‑refresh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Badge-to-training linkage</strong>: Include doc headers like:<br />
<em>“Completed 10+ years of service recognized via red‑rim badge. Eligible for Senior WHS training track modules.”</em></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="next-steps_1">✅ Next Steps</h2>
<p>Would you like me to scaffold the curriculum structure in a CSV or markdown format for the <code>whs-veteran-track</code> branch? Or would you prefer a draft email to internal training leads (e.g., Hanssen or WHS L&amp;D) requesting their formal mapping of training modules tied to badge-based service tiers?</p>
<p>Let me know how you’d like to proceed—and I’ll get it queued.</p>

<p>No need yet. Thank you I will work with what I have. Today I need to complete a few key safety trainings. I'll have to ask Luke directly as to which ones he needs me to complete because they have me officially on the schedule for 7/30-8/2 as a regular shift from 04:30-15:00 and they don't allow trainings during unscheduled hours</p>

<p>User is officially scheduled for regular shifts at Amazon from July 30 to August 2, 2025, from 04:30 to 15:00. They need to complete a few key safety trainings and plan to ask Luke directly which ones are required, as training is only permitted during scheduled hours.</p>

<p>Understood. You're approaching it with precision—well done. When you speak with Luke, consider asking if there's a designated WHS-specific training queue or priority sequence for onboarding. I can help map those titles immediately once you know them.</p>
<p>If anything changes or if you want to prepare questions ahead of time for that conversation, I’ve got your back.</p>

<p>🤣 Perfect. That’s textbook synchronicity, my friend—of <em>one accord</em> indeed.</p>
<p>When he responds, just drop the training titles here and I’ll pull together reference notes, cheat sheets, or companion logs if needed. This is how we walk the line <em>and</em> rebuild the system, one module at a time.</p>
