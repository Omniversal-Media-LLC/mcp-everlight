<p>Can you get a passport without a driver's license since they stole mine </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233123328546z-assistant">2025-08-14T23:31:23.328546Z — assistant</h2>

<p>Yes — you can still get a U.S. passport even if you don’t have your driver’s license anymore.<br />
A driver’s license is just one of several acceptable forms of <em>primary identification</em> the State Department will take. If it’s lost or stolen, you have a couple of options:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. Use another form of primary ID</strong><br />
Examples include:
- A current, valid government-issued photo ID (state ID card, military ID, etc.)
- A valid or expired U.S. passport (even if expired, it can work for ID)
- A Certificate of Naturalization or Citizenship
- A U.S. Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Use secondary ID + extra documentation</strong><br />
If you don’t have any current government-issued photo ID at all, you can:
- Bring <strong>as much secondary identification as possible</strong>, such as:
  - Social Security card
  - Employee ID
  - Student ID
  - Medicare/Medicaid card
  - Birth certificate
  - Utility bills, bank statements, or insurance cards in your name
- Fill out <strong>Form DS-71</strong> (Affidavit of Identifying Witness) — you bring someone with valid ID who has known you for at least 2 years, and they swear to your identity in front of the passport agent.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Police report &amp; replacement ID</strong><br />
If your license was stolen, it’s smart to:
- File a police report — bring a copy to your passport appointment.
- Consider getting a state ID or replacement license first — it may simplify the passport process, but it’s not strictly required.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can give you a <strong>step-by-step “no-driver’s-license” passport application plan</strong> that covers exactly what to bring so you don’t get turned away at the post office or passport agency.<br />
Do you want me to make that for you?</p>

<p>My license was stolen by the police</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233228237464z-assistant">2025-08-14T23:32:28.237464Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Got it — if the police took your driver’s license and you don’t have it back, that changes the tone of how you handle the passport appointment, but it still doesn’t stop you from getting one.  </p>
<p>Here’s what you’d do in that case:  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="1-gather-alternate-primary-id"><strong>1. Gather Alternate Primary ID</strong></h2>
<p>If you have <em>any other</em> government-issued photo ID, bring it:
- State-issued photo ID card (if you’ve replaced your license with one)<br />
- Previous U.S. passport (even expired)<br />
- Military ID, tribal ID, or government employee ID  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="2-if-you-have-no-other-primary-id"><strong>2. If You Have No Other Primary ID</strong></h2>
<p>You can apply using <strong>secondary evidence of identity</strong>:
- Bring <strong>multiple</strong> documents that show your name and preferably a photo:
  - Birth certificate (certified copy)
  - Social Security card
  - School ID
  - Work ID
  - Insurance card
  - Bank statements, pay stubs, or tax documents with your name/address
- Fill out <strong>Form DS-71</strong> (Identifying Witness) and bring someone who:
  - Is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
  - Has known you personally for at least 2 years
  - Has valid government-issued photo ID</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-bring-proof-of-the-loss"><strong>3. Bring Proof of the Loss</strong></h2>
<p>Since your license was taken by police:
- Get <strong>any written record</strong> you can — police report, property receipt, court paperwork, or case number
- If they didn’t give you anything, <strong>write a signed statement</strong> explaining:
  - When, where, and by whom the license was taken
  - Why it hasn’t been returned
- Bring that statement with you — it helps the passport agent see why you can’t show a driver’s license</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="4-application-process"><strong>4. Application Process</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fill out <strong>Form DS-11</strong> (first-time or replacement passport)</li>
<li>Bring original proof of citizenship (birth certificate, naturalization certificate, etc.)</li>
<li>Bring your alternate ID or secondary docs + witness</li>
<li>Bring passport photo(s)</li>
<li>Apply in person at a passport acceptance facility or regional passport agency</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can put together a <strong>"Police-Seized License Passport Survival Kit"</strong> — basically a checklist you can take to the passport office so you walk in bulletproof, even without your license.<br />
That way they can’t use the missing ID as an excuse to delay you.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to do that?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233255467463z-user">2025-08-14T23:32:55.467463Z — user</h2>
<p>I have birth certificate bank mail and ss card</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233255593676z-assistant">2025-08-14T23:32:55.593676Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect — with a <strong>birth certificate</strong>, <strong>Social Security card</strong>, and <strong>recent bank mail</strong> you can absolutely still get a passport.<br />
You’ll just be going the <strong>secondary ID + identifying witness</strong> route unless you also have another government photo ID.  </p>
<p>Here’s exactly how to do it so they approve you first try:  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="police-seized-license-passport-plan"><strong>Police-Seized License Passport Plan</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-primary-proof-of-citizenship"><strong>1. Primary Proof of Citizenship</strong></h3>
<p>✅ Certified birth certificate — you already have this.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-proof-of-identity-alternate-method"><strong>2. Proof of Identity (Alternate Method)</strong></h3>
<p>Since you don’t have a driver’s license:
- Bring <strong>all secondary ID you can</strong>:
  - Social Security card
  - Bank mail (recent — 30 days or newer is ideal)
  - Any other mail with your name + address<br />
  - Old school or work ID if you have one
  - Insurance card (health, auto, etc.) if in your name</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-identifying-witness"><strong>3. Identifying Witness</strong></h3>
<p>If possible, bring a person who:
- Is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
- Has known you for at least 2 years
- Has valid government-issued photo ID
- Will fill out <strong>Form DS-71</strong> at the passport office, swearing to your identity</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-documentation-of-the-police-taking-your-license"><strong>4. Documentation of the Police Taking Your License</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Best: Police report, property receipt, or court record  </li>
<li>If you have none: Write a <strong>signed statement</strong> for the passport clerk explaining:</li>
<li>Date, place, and name of the agency/officer that took it</li>
<li>Why it was taken</li>
<li>That you do not have it in your possession</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="5-at-the-passport-office"><strong>5. At the Passport Office</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fill out <strong>Form DS-11</strong> for a new passport  </li>
<li>Tell them up front: <em>“I’m applying without a driver’s license because my ID was seized by police — here’s my proof of citizenship, my secondary ID, and my identifying witness.”</em></li>
<li>Pay fee (currently $165 for book + execution fee for adults)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can <strong>write that “license taken by police” statement for you</strong> in the exact official style they like so you can just sign it and hand it over.<br />
That will make them less likely to push back.  </p>
<p>Want me to draft that for you?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233347505976z-user">2025-08-14T23:33:47.505976Z — user</h2>
<p>They didn't seize it they stole it because that's what they do - treat the innocent as guilty until proven otherwise </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233347690432z-assistant">2025-08-14T23:33:47.690432Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Understood — so we’re not talking about a formal seizure with a property receipt; we’re talking about an <em>unlawful taking</em>, and you have no official record from them acknowledging it.  </p>
<p>In that case, the passport office is not going to weigh in on the criminal aspect — they just need a paper trail explaining why you can’t hand them a driver’s license.<br />
We can still frame this <strong>in a neutral, factual way</strong> so it passes their process but still leaves you free to pursue the misconduct separately.  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-handle-it-for-passport-purposes"><strong>How to Handle It for Passport Purposes</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep emotion out</strong> for this document — the clerk’s job is just to verify identity, not judge your case.</li>
<li>Simply state that your license is unavailable due to being taken by law enforcement without return.</li>
<li>The goal is to <em>explain absence</em>, not <em>argue fault</em> — that battle is for elsewhere (complaint, court, press, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Here’s a draft statement you could bring:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statement Regarding Missing Driver’s License</strong><br />
I, [Full Legal Name], declare that my state-issued driver’s license is not in my possession.<br />
On or about [Date], during an interaction with law enforcement officers from [Agency Name, if known], my driver’s license was taken from me and has not been returned.<br />
I have been unable to recover it despite my attempts. I am providing alternate forms of identification in support of my U.S. passport application, including my certified birth certificate, Social Security card, and recent bank correspondence.<br />
I declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.  </p>
<p>Signature: <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><br />
Date: <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong></strong>  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can also give you a <strong>parallel “accountability version”</strong> of this — a sharper, documented version you could send to state authorities, DOJ Civil Rights, or even media later, which <em>does</em> call it theft and wrongful treatment.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to prepare both so you have one for the passport office and one for the fight?</p>

<p>Instead can you draft a formal letter and demand for the return of my property that I can send Pasco county sheriff's department as well as a public records request for body cam and dash cam footage?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-14t233503579620z-assistant">2025-08-14T23:35:03.579620Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Absolutely — we can do this in two coordinated parts:  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Formal Demand for Return of Property</strong> — clearly stating they took your license, you expect it back, and you’re asserting your rights.  </li>
<li><strong>Florida Public Records Request</strong> — demanding all body-worn camera and dash cam footage from the encounter, plus any related incident or property logs.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a draft you can send (preferably via certified mail so you have proof they got it).  </p>

<p><strong>To Whom It May Concern:</strong>  </p>
<p>On or about <strong>[Exact Date of Incident]</strong>, during an interaction with deputies of the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office, my valid Florida driver’s license was taken from me and has not been returned. I was not provided a receipt, notice of seizure, or any lawful documentation indicating that my license was confiscated pursuant to statutory authority.  </p>
<p>I am formally demanding the <strong>immediate return of my property</strong> — my Florida driver’s license — or a written explanation citing the legal authority for its continued retention. If my license has been destroyed, suspended, or transferred to any other agency, I require prompt written confirmation of when, how, and under what authority that action was taken.  </p>
<p>Pursuant to <strong>Florida’s Public Records Law, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes</strong>, I also request copies of the following records related to the incident:  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All body-worn camera and in-car dash camera footage</strong> from every deputy present during the interaction on [Exact Date] from [Location of Incident].  </li>
<li><strong>Any and all incident reports, arrest reports, field interview cards, or call-for-service logs</strong> related to the encounter.  </li>
<li><strong>Any property or evidence intake logs</strong> referencing my Florida driver’s license.  </li>
<li><strong>Any written or electronic communications</strong> among deputies, supervisors, or other agencies regarding my driver’s license.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I request these records in <strong>electronic format</strong> if possible, and I am willing to pay reasonable duplication fees not to exceed $50 without further authorization.  </p>
<p>Pursuant to <strong>§119.07(1)(c), Fla. Stat.</strong>, if you claim any exemption or refuse to produce any record, please state the specific statutory exemption and provide a written explanation.  </p>
<p>Under Florida law, this request must be acknowledged promptly and fulfilled within a reasonable time. Please respond in writing to the address or email listed above.  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong>  </p>
<p>[Your Full Legal Name]<br />
(Sign here if mailing hard copy)  </p>

<p>If you want, I can also prepare:<br />
- A <strong>second version</strong> of the demand letter that cites <em>federal civil rights</em> case law, putting them on notice for unlawful deprivation of property.<br />
- A <strong>follow-up request template</strong> in case they try to stall or overcharge you for the bodycam/dashcam footage.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to make those so you’ve got both barrels loaded if they drag their feet?</p>

<p>Got it — here’s the <strong>federal-civil-rights-notice</strong> version of the letter.<br />
It’s more aggressive, preserves your rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and makes it clear you’re documenting for litigation if they don’t comply.  </p>

<p><strong>To the Custodian of Records and the Sheriff:</strong>  </p>
<p>On or about <strong>[Exact Date of Incident]</strong>, deputies of the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office took possession of my valid Florida driver’s license during an encounter at <strong>[Location of Incident]</strong>. I was not arrested, not provided with a receipt or notice of lawful seizure, and no statutory authority was cited for the taking.  </p>
<p>The continued deprivation of my personal property without due process of law violates my rights under the <strong>Fourth Amendment</strong> (unreasonable seizure) and <strong>Fourteenth Amendment</strong> (deprivation of property without due process) to the United States Constitution, actionable under <strong>42 U.S.C. § 1983</strong>.  </p>
<p>I hereby <strong>demand the immediate return of my driver’s license</strong> or written proof of lawful disposition, including the specific statute, policy, or court order authorizing its retention, transfer, or destruction. If the license was transferred to any other agency, provide the date, recipient, and a copy of the transmittal record.  </p>
<p>Additionally, pursuant to the <strong>Florida Public Records Law, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes</strong>, I request the following:  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All body-worn camera and in-car dash camera recordings</strong> from every deputy present during the encounter on [Exact Date] from [Location of Incident], covering the period from 10 minutes before to 10 minutes after the interaction.  </li>
<li><strong>All incident reports, arrest reports, field interview reports, or CAD/call-for-service logs</strong> related to the encounter.  </li>
<li><strong>All property/evidence logs, intake forms, or internal communications</strong> referencing my driver’s license.  </li>
<li><strong>All interagency communications</strong> (including emails, texts, or CAD notes) related to the possession, transfer, or disposition of my driver’s license.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I request these records in <strong>electronic format</strong> whenever possible. Please provide an itemized cost estimate if charges will exceed $50.  </p>
<p>If you claim any exemption, you must state the <strong>specific statutory citation</strong> and provide a written explanation pursuant to § 119.07(1)(c), Fla. Stat.  </p>
<p><strong>Preservation Notice:</strong> You are hereby directed to preserve all documents, audio/video recordings, and electronic communications relevant to this matter, as they may be used as evidence in a potential federal civil rights action. Failure to preserve may constitute spoliation of evidence.  </p>
<p>This letter is not only a public records request and property demand, but also <strong>formal notice</strong> that you may be held personally and officially liable for the continued unlawful deprivation of my property and any concealment or destruction of responsive records.  </p>

<p>If you send this by <strong>certified mail, return receipt requested</strong>, you’ll have legal proof they received it — crucial if you end up filing in federal court.  </p>
<p>If you want, I can now give you a <strong>follow-up escalation plan</strong> with exact timelines — what to do if they stall, deny, or give you an incomplete response, and when to pivot to FDLE, DOJ Civil Rights, or federal court.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to map that out for you?</p>

That letter will be sitting there like a loaded cannon for when you’re ready to fire it off.  </p>
