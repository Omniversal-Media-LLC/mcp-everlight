<p>I can’t look up or trace specific IMEI numbers directly. However, I can tell you <strong>what an IMEI number is</strong> and <strong>how you can use it</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-imei">What is an IMEI?</h3>
<p><strong>IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)</strong> is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device with cellular capabilities. It identifies the device on a mobile network.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-can-you-do-with-an-imei">What Can You Do With an IMEI?</h3>
<p>You can:
- <strong>Check if a device is blacklisted or reported stolen</strong> using sites like:
  - <a href="https://www.imei.info/">IMEI.info</a>
  - <a href="https://swappa.com/esn">Swappa IMEI Checker</a>
  - <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/resources/bring-your-own-phone">T-Mobile IMEI Status</a>
- <strong>Confirm compatibility</strong> with a carrier
- <strong>Track or block a stolen phone</strong> through your carrier or device manufacturer (if you’re the registered owner)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-to-use-the-imei-safely">How to Use the IMEI Safely</h3>
<p>If you're verifying a device before purchase or checking your own phone:
1. Go to one of the sites above
2. Paste the IMEI number
3. Review details like:
   - Make/model
   - Activation status
   - Blacklist status
   - Carrier lock status</p>
<p>Would you like me to guide you through checking the IMEI on a specific site?</p>

<p>Tmobile asks for the 10$ k giveaway question - what’s a a proud moment I went outta my way to help a customer - can you write in under 250 words how we protected Cody’s rights and got his judge disqualified and a press box installed in her courtroom </p>
<h2 id="2025-05-22t124235968338z-assistant">2025-05-22T12:42:35.968338Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Here's a concise, professional version of that story tailored for the T-Mobile $10K giveaway prompt, staying under 250 words:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>One of my proudest moments was standing up for a client named Cody, who was facing a biased legal process in a small-town courtroom.</strong>  </p>
<p>Despite not being a licensed attorney, I conducted thorough legal research and uncovered multiple ethical violations committed by the presiding judge, including procedural misconduct and a blatant disregard for Cody’s constitutional rights. I worked tirelessly to draft the necessary filings, helped Cody submit a formal judicial disqualification motion, and supported him throughout the process with clarity and confidence.</p>
<p>The motion was successful: the judge was officially disqualified from the case.</p>
<p>But we didn’t stop there. Recognizing a systemic issue with transparency in that courtroom, I rallied support and submitted a request for greater media access. This advocacy led to the unprecedented installation of a <strong>press box</strong> in her courtroom — a powerful win for public accountability.</p>
<p>This wasn’t about revenge or spectacle. It was about integrity, justice, and the power of community-led action to protect individuals from being steamrolled by unjust systems. Cody’s case became a symbol of hope for others in the area, showing that with courage and the right support, even the most entrenched injustices can be confronted and changed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Would you like to adapt this for a more casual, storytelling tone, or tighten it further for character count?</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-22t124305089350z-user">2025-05-22T12:43:05.089350Z — user</h2>
<p>Can you leave Cody’s name out of it please </p>
<h2 id="2025-05-22t124306589734z-assistant">2025-05-22T12:43:06.589734Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Of course — here’s the revised version without using Cody’s name:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>One of my proudest moments was stepping in to defend someone whose rights were being trampled in a small-town courtroom.</strong>  </p>
<p>Despite not being a licensed attorney, I conducted deep legal research, uncovered ethical violations by the judge, and helped draft a judicial disqualification motion that ultimately succeeded. The judge was formally removed from the case — a rare and powerful outcome in such a tightly controlled environment.</p>
<p>But the mission didn’t end there. I then advocated for greater transparency in that courtroom, which led to the successful installation of a <strong>press box</strong> — ensuring media presence and public accountability for the first time in that space.</p>
<p>What made this moment meaningful wasn’t just the legal win — it was witnessing the shift in energy when someone who felt helpless began to feel seen, protected, and empowered. It reminded me that justice isn’t something we wait for; it’s something we build, one courageous action at a time.</p>

<p>Let me know if you’d like to add a closing line tailored to T-Mobile’s theme (e.g., how you’d use the funds to amplify this kind of advocacy).</p>
