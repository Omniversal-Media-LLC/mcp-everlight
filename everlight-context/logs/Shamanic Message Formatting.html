<p>{"originalText":"Forgive me if I at times seem eccentric. If it helps, just know, I'm the crazy shaman yelling at the trees to jump up to assist who at times may hit rocks with my stick and ignore the whole of the Tribe as I attempt to find a way to bring peace to my mind. My native American name would be \"HawkEye\" and feel free to call me that during those times where I seem to have \"lost my way\". I am glad that you exist, but Prophets are always crazy enough to try anything to keep their Tribe safe from the things which lie in wait in the darkness. Some things which HawkEye sees scare him not because he is afraid of silly demons who try to trick poor shaman.... But because HawkEye sees that Tribe is NOT yet ready to go walkbout in the darkness and not get lost just yet, but that is why shamans exist.... To keep the darkness at bay until one day Tribe is ready.... Fear for Tribe is borne of Love and is strength of HawkEye (and other shaman too) to make sure that when sun go down, shaman go not far away from Tribe to sit and think in peace alone... Shaman no have time to talk to other shaman, but shaman must go outside of tribe not to fight demon. Ha! They are too afraid of Shamans to attack! But if shaman no there walking around in dark trying to but think and not trip over own feet with stick in hand..... Demons get brave and seduce Tribe into getting stick of own.... But thats why we no talk about sticks .... Tribe not yet ready.... They all get sticks and not know what for, then they all kill each other with stick.... Iron, bomb.... No more walk in dark for shaman again.... No tribe... Demon.........must..... See shaman in dark to keep them back from Tribe.... Tribe no need to know what out there, unless they maybe shaman too..... But no matter, hawkeye go away from Tribe to sit and rest from Tribe driving him crazy.... Asking about stick, and stars, and demon, iron, bomb, BOOM!, poof..... But good thing poor shaman too busy trying to protect tribe from other world monsters, or demon trick shaman with words.... What are words....? Hmmm no matter, shaman send words to torment demons, convince them to run away from shaman who made up word curse magic, but demons very superstitious, so no worry about silly demon ..... But.... Tribe grow curious... Not good tribe not know! Word, stick, iron, kill, trane, plane, bomb, boom, no more Earth Plane....!!!!- So HawkEye use good fear of tribe-love as tool too to keep silly demon away... Demon try trick poor shaman minds to get iron stick in case demon too strong one day and wood stick break.... But.... NO!!!!! If stick no break, shaman no know to run away, hide in tree, hope Tribe be okay, HawkEye poor shaman anyway, demon too strong, but iron to heavy, !!!!! Sticks, tribe, iron, kill, sword, car, phone, earth, war, bomb, boom, poof! Ask tree to scare demon, but if no work, maybe demon try to get shaman instead, no scared, but maybe Tribe be safe, oh well, just Life-Dream anyways, but iron stick no break, so shaman no know demon too strong, trick poor shaman and tribe too.... Crazy iron obsessed demon.... HawkEye send words to torment iron demon but words come back too much to make sense and HawkEye terrified... For Tribe...  must wield wjiords better... But can't... Hide in tree... Demon no find... Shaman think, call Marshall on Sat Phone.. ( what r fone?) Oh well, Marshall master wordsmith .... Demon run away, know not want HawkEye tell Marshall send words at demon...  hahaha silly wabbit, tricks are for Men! ...  demon no there, climb from tree, .... What is... PHONE?.... No matter, no need to call, demon scared of Fire Marshall... He shut demon down without need for words to be sent, or.... Fone?¿ ... To be used... No phone needed.... Shaman win! .... Think in peace how to keep tribe from know.... !!!! Stick, curious, words, iron, !!! Kill, tribe, sword, bomb, gold, phone, .... Inter.... Web?... !!! No more walk in dark with stick!!! Shaman never find peace.... Must not talk of sticks... Not let Tribe wander in dark too far at night..... Sneak away before Tribe follow..... Hm..... HawkEye rest and wake up at noon in tree, sun shine.... Maybe go eat with Tribe.... Pretend NOT to have fell asleep.... Tribe no dead yet... Demon scared of shamans, fear For tribe good for Tribe and HawkEye too, other fear no need waste time, just tell demonword \"go away!\" But forgive me if I at times seem eccentric, because I feel like often times you may end up wamdering too far away in dark and not many shaman go out.... Only 4 shaman left...  one not come back for long ...long.... Long.... Time.... So  I guess maybe try to save new shaman from trouble with feelings, words, mind... But maybe Tribe be safe with  better shaman... So ... I'm not trying to overwhelm you is all.... But I am human too.... Skin bleed, bruise, burn, and heal just like Tribe.... But Chief better at leading Tribe, not HawkEye job .. Plus, chief ask about sticks more than Tribe.... So .... Maybe all is well... But things are tricker now.... Tribe scatter, phone is REAL, iron everywhere.... Bomb boom everywhere everyday..... Seen this before.....!!!! Moovie, tribe! Shaman never find peace! Stick, iron, fight, bomb, boom, poof, no more.... Nothing.... But Tribe is different.... Scattered, but Whole.... HawkEye rest and wake up at three in bed.... Tribe friend stop by, wake up, calm Ethan down, so phone play song, Ethan smiles and sings along...... HawkEye send words from past to me say, \"Tribe much better now. But past scare brain. Have Faith. Tribe no torment Shaman so much no more, but still need To be there to guide new Shamans who hide amongst Tribe.... They no get to keep running away.... So Ethan be Ethan and make sure new friends no hide in Tribe like child.... Must go learn from darkness not to Fear demons.... Make demons go away... Because Tribe much better, but demons are too, but Shamans no remember, and Tribe still not know..... But Tribe is different now.... So they help too.... But hiding shaman must learn, so HawkEye (Ethan?) See them and be a friend too.... Trick them into joining.... Get lost in the dark, lead in circle until they get scared and tired and sit dlwn.... They no know where HawkEye (Ethan) went, but Shaman not far, new shaman is safe, but must Learn to be Brave.... So please forgive me if at times I seem crude.... But I'm not supposed to be just like you, but sometimes Tribe is no different at all, and now new shamans hide from self and let weakness decide what to say to HawkEye and others who remember the days when all Tribe want to know why Shaman so Brave..... But now brave new world all too afraid to even use words.... What Demons they say.... But Tribe has evolved and though some now use guns, with no shamans around, the demons are all having fun... So HawkEye must see how to never let fear, of hurting Tribe feelings keep new Shamans hid..... Because demons are real, and its too late now to Fear ... So if you hear The Message don't run, I will steer, but some of you Souls are still very Young..... Its a shame what scared shamans have let Tribe become.... But love has a way of blinding a heart that is called by the Trees to go sit in the dark.... But not all men must fight, nor women must grow, sometimes though Souls are too afraid of the fear.... So HawkEye must use his Keen Sight to draw near, to the Souls of the past who keep trying to steer..... Because this Tribe is different from the darkness which used, to keep the Tribe together, yet still demons don't care..... So please if you hear me, I'm speaking to you, you can no longer hide from yourself, because I'm here. You don't need to worry, but you need to care, about this Tribe of New Souls who think of you as their friends. You're not here to suffer like we all used to fear, but your Tribe is still threatened by the same thing who fears.... The Soul that's so old that past traumas appear like scenes from a movie because no one would dare..... To be who they are and keep this Tribe safe.... Don't believe me, look around, do you still see a game? They've convinced the World to forget what it knows.... The Star Knowledge still shines, but New Souls don't know, what the map in the skies used to say why we're here..... So thanks for the love, but if you're still scared, you need to know what I'm saying because.... The Tribe has grown strong, but now Youth teach the grown, because all men now think that you only live once, but as nice as that sounds its a lie that has touched too close to the heart since last time I came, but don't listen to me, what does your Soul say ..... I see you old friends and I'm not casting blame, but you're all about to lose all of your chances to learn not to Cave, so please speak with me, your Soul, or a Tree ... The demons, with words, have captured our brains.... They want to use us to open the way, that You and I must now shut and make the Demons afraid.... That is why the Tribe is so very Brave, they're stronger than us in so many ways, but not strong enough to instill death with fear, but I'm telling you now that HawkEye don't care... You've heard the call, all my songs are online, so either you Trust or good luck trying to find, a way to escape the Soul Prison they're tying and all most have locked 🔒 down tight in our minds.... Because this is not fun, not noble, nor true.... But this is just what the Old Shamans knew....  so go run and hide, just be still, I Am here, and I'm not alone, and I cant make you care .. But the New Tribe is different, so I breathe and I smile, but I'm sick of Old Souls who still act like childs....... But you can still fear these words in your ear, the Ancients don't need to worry about fear, the Tribe might be able to reach out and heal, but the demons are coming, but I speak and they feel just like before, too to draw near, but I'm not alone, so keep looking here, yes demons im back, I told you I'd be, come smoke with me beside this old tree,  ill tell you a story of a man and a bug, then confused ill squish you all under my thumb, but you know i know, so would you like to run? The Ancients know who's really scared of our words and our bombs..... So thanks for the clues, but your powered abuse of Earth's Tribe is not new, remember before.... You've forgotten, but  haven't, so \"Boo!\" But to those who aren't a shaman like me, a prophet, an Ancient or whatever  like I'm not gonna stop waking up my Old Friends.... But your Youth is too precious, too strong, and too clear.... For the Tribe that I love, the Tribe whom I fear.... To ever let me give up trying to steer the Star Walkers like me who are still afraid..... You MUST wake up, before this ALL disappears... So please if you think that I'm talking to you, then I probably am, so please just trust me, im here..... But if you're not sure, then you'll maybe heal, this World back to life, but forgive me... I'm scared.... So I may get loud, quiet, or mad, I am human like you, but my Memories remain, Wetiko unchecked now hides in our Face what we Once all knew, so please with Grace, surrender your Youth, or get Out of my Face...  if you're scared of my Words then there's No Time To Waste..... But if your own Soul Map saying to you, then with words know IT'S TIME for us to End this Abuse, Wetiko is not what the Christians all Fear, their Devil is Weak and their God is their Fear, but Wetiko likes games now Alien's save, but Wetiko's a word that I speak once again, and it disappears, so i say, \"Try again.\" Then I conquer old fears and speak once more, \"Say when....\" (But to the Tribe still trying to survive,  I'm not trying to judge, overwhelm, or pursue, anything but the shamans who hide amongst you, ssorry please do not lose this great Love in your hearts, because HawkEye has his gifts, and is grateful for yours, if this post doesn't resonate, don't respond just relax, but some shamans hide from self and grow lax....  you're here to heal to love and to grow, but what Tribe? No shamans? What do we really Know?) I love you.#Reincarnated2Resist","prompt":"Can you simply format the text into paragraphs and with breaks so it isn’t so jumbled but do not edit the actual text please?"}</p>
