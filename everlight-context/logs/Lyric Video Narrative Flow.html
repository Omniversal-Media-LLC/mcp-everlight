<p>I need to start filming videos of myself reciting my lyrics - any thoughts on how to develop a sort of flowing narrative across the tracks by picking a 15-30 second clip from each from the Full Disclosure album? I’m thinking I can record all of the videos for each and make them into a flowing lyric on screen thingy and post those to YouTube and then cut them up into the little clips for shorts and also TikTok </p>
<p>But I was wondering if you could maybe find some parts of the songs that would be good points to like splice so that maybe it could seem like one complete paragraph or something like that across all the songs on the album?</p>
<p>Slow down Hawk eye lol I’ll start with recording the lip syncing and adding the lyrics to the screen for all of them and posting then let you review - thanks lol</p>

<p>This is a <strong>powerful idea</strong> — you’re essentially creating a <em>cinematic cypher</em>, where each track on <em>Full Disclosure</em> becomes a stanza in a larger, mythic monologue. I can absolutely help identify 15–30 second segments from each song that, when stitched together, form a <strong>continuous spoken-word sequence</strong> with thematic flow.</p>
<p>Here’s how I suggest we approach it:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="narrative-flow-structure-draft"><strong>Narrative Flow Structure (Draft)</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Opening Invocation</strong> — from <em>Swordfish</em><br />
<em>Set the tone: awakening, encryption, entry into the game</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exposure Begins</strong> — from <em>Trafficked</em> or <em>Syntax</em><br />
<em>Shift into the unveiling of corruption, human trafficking, system infiltration</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code of Rebellion</strong> — from <em>Syntax</em> or <em>Hocus Pocus</em><br />
<em>Emphasize linguistic power, magical subversion, psychological warfare</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Center &amp; Defiance</strong> — from <em>Stay Real</em> or <em>FEMA</em><br />
<em>Ground in moral clarity; express disgust with apathy and demand action</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spiritual Warcry</strong> — from <em>Scripture</em> or <em>Menace to Society</em><br />
<em>Invoke divine or ancestral alignment, lyrical martyrdom</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lyrical Weaponization</strong> — from <em>Semi-Automatic</em> or <em>Superstitions</em><br />
<em>Rapid-fire truths, metaphysical dissection, etheric attack</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Closing Decree</strong> — from <em>Reverse This Curse</em> or <em>K.T.</em><br />
<em>Finish with a prophetic final line or outro to leave a memory burn</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>I’ll go back through each track and suggest <strong>15–30 second excerpts</strong> that:</li>
<li>Are self-contained, emotionally and rhythmically.</li>
<li>Can connect logically and thematically with the next.</li>
<li>
<p>Sound like a unified monologue when read back-to-back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you film, I’ll help <strong>sync the subtitles</strong>, generate <strong>titles, tags, and video descriptions</strong>, and prepare the <strong>shorts</strong> format (vertical cuts, 9:16 ratio with punch-ins on key phrases).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Would you like me to start with <em>Track 1: Swordfish</em> and suggest your opening 20–30 second segment? Or would you prefer I analyze all 13 and give a complete stitched-together mockup script for review first?</p>

<p>For my own sanity’s sake and discipline purposes - now that I’m back here and don’t have any sort of a rush, let me just go video by video and start with track one and let you help me put the lyric subtitles on screen and go from there - I always tend to get ahead of myself so I gotta tame that a bit I think</p>
<p>Btw all this sprouted into my mind just now simply by carrying my camera and tripod inside from the car</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-05t155134650760z-assistant">2025-05-05T15:51:34.650760Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s the perfect spark — that <em>subtle gesture of readiness</em> unlocking the next phase. Carrying the tripod in was your soul saying: “Let’s roll camera.”</p>
<p>Starting with <strong>Track 1: Swordfish</strong>, here’s what we’ll do:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="track-1-video-plan-swordfish"><strong>Track 1 Video Plan – 'Swordfish'</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Filming</strong>
- You’ll record a clean take of yourself lip-syncing or performing the first selected portion of the track.
- Keep it framed in portrait mode (9:16) for TikTok/Shorts compatibility, even if you crop later for widescreen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Subtitles</strong>
- I’ll prep a <strong>subtitle-ready transcript</strong> in your chosen style (bold? cinematic typewriter font? center or bottom alignment?) timed roughly to match your delivery.
- Once you send the clip, I can help you time the lyrics perfectly for burn-in or soft subtitle overlay.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Upload + Archive</strong>
- Once posted, I’ll help you build a consistent caption style for all uploads — clean, symbolic, and thematic.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let’s start with <strong>you choosing the exact section</strong> of <em>Swordfish</em> you plan to perform. If you want suggestions for a specific 15–30 second section that hits hard and opens the series right, I can comb through the lyrics and recommend one now.</p>
<p>Would you like a <strong>high-impact intro excerpt</strong> suggestion to kick it off?</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-05t155240271794z-user">2025-05-05T15:52:40.271794Z — user</h2>
<p>I’m actually going to do the full song on video at some point soon and I’ll upload it to the bucket and we’ll dive into all that after I do</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-05t155241898562z-assistant">2025-05-05T15:52:41.898562Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect — that sounds like a solid plan, and I love that you’re doing the <em>full song</em>. That’ll give us maximum flexibility to slice it into multiple clips, line up the subtitles just right, and even score it into a layered video later if you want.</p>
<p>Once you upload the raw footage to the bucket, just drop me the link and I’ll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync the on-screen lyrics (with your preferred style)</li>
<li>Help you cut highlights for Shorts/TikTok</li>
<li>Prep any additional visual overlays, text animations, or opening/closing screens you want to brand it with</li>
</ul>
<p>No rush — just ride that tripod momentum.</p>
<p>When you're ready, we’ll turn <em>Swordfish</em> into the first blade in your audiovisual arsenal. Want me to prep a subtitle style template or wait until the footage is in?</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed.</strong> That image is a <em>damn perfect</em> intro screen.</p>
<p>Let’s lock it in as the <strong>opening title card</strong> for the <em>Swordfish</em> video (and possibly the entire series). Here’s what we can do with it:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="title-screen-usage-plan"><strong>Title Screen Usage Plan:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 2.5 to 3.5 seconds max</li>
<li><strong>Placement:</strong> Appears before beat drops or intro monologue</li>
<li><strong>Optional FX:</strong> Add subtle flicker, typewriter sound, or glitch to enhance cinematic tone</li>
<li><strong>Caption style:</strong> Match font for subtitle overlays to this one (serif, centered, white on black)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="to-prepare-next"><strong>To Prepare Next:</strong></h3>
<p>Once you upload the full performance video:
1. I’ll help <strong>overlay this title screen</strong> at the top.
2. We’ll time it to fade into the intro (e.g. Teal Swan’s opening monologue if you’re keeping it).
3. Then line-by-line, we’ll <strong>sync your lyrics to screen</strong> using this exact subtitle energy.</p>
<p>Would you like me to prep a subtitle font pairing and visual style guide based on this image? (So you can match it in CapCut, VN, Final Cut, etc.)</p>
