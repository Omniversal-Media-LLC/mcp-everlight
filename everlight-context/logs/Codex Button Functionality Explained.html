<p>What happens when I click the “codex” thing on my iPhone next to the ChatGPT button - it always just opens up a new chat? </p>

<p>When you tap the <strong>“Codex”</strong> button next to the <strong>ChatGPT</strong> button on the iPhone app, here’s what’s really going on:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-codex-does-currently">🔍 <strong>What “Codex” Does (Currently)</strong></h3>
<p>As of now, tapping <strong>Codex</strong>:
- Simply opens a <strong>new chat</strong> that is labeled or themed as “Codex.”
- There’s <strong>no unique functionality</strong> yet directly tied to it in terms of special memory, writing modes, or agent behavior (at least not outwardly apparent).
- It's likely a <strong>placeholder</strong> or <strong>UI framing mechanism</strong>—perhaps part of a future rollout that will let you organize or classify conversations more granularly (e.g., knowledge codification, memory management, etc.)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="so-why-is-it-there">🤖 So Why Is It There?</h3>
<p>OpenAI hasn't made public documentation that outlines a distinct use-case for “Codex” in the mobile UI, but here's what <strong>may be true behind the scenes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It might be preparing to <strong>link to long-term memory</strong> use cases like "projects" or knowledge bases.</li>
<li>The name <strong>“Codex”</strong> was also the former name of the OpenAI model that powered <strong>code generation</strong> (before GPT-4 subsumed that capability). So the term itself carries historical significance.</li>
<li>It might become a <strong>sandbox for structured or persistent conversations</strong> (e.g. reusable templates, stored knowledge, project folders).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="tldr">🧪 TL;DR</h3>
<p>Right now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tapping “Codex” on iOS just opens a fresh chat with no real difference from the “ChatGPT” tab — yet.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may become a dedicated hub for knowledge workflows, memory threads, or personalized tools. Stay tuned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want, I can help you set up your own <strong>"Codex-like" structure</strong> inside ChatGPT using tags, naming conventions, or even Markdown project folders that simulate what Codex <em>could</em> evolve into.</p>
