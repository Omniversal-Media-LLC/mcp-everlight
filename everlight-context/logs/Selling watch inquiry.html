<p>Not quite yet. The screen you’re showing means that your Apple ID currently has <strong>no devices registered with “Find My” turned on</strong>.  </p>
<p>For you to safely sell an Apple Watch (or any Apple device), you’ll need to make sure <strong>Activation Lock</strong> is removed, otherwise the buyer won’t be able to use it. Here’s how you can check:</p>
<h3 id="1-make-sure-find-my-is-off">1. Make sure Find My is off</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the watch itself (if you still have it paired), go to <strong>Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Find My</strong> and turn it off.  </li>
<li>If the watch is unpaired from your iPhone, the unpairing process usually <strong>turns off Find My automatically</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-check-icloud-like-your-screenshot">2. Check iCloud (like your screenshot)</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the watch no longer shows up here, that’s a good sign that <strong>Activation Lock is gone</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-sign-out-of-icloud-on-the-watch-if-you-still-can">3. Sign out of iCloud on the watch (if you still can)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you’re fully signed out of your Apple ID on the watch.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-erase-the-watch">4. Erase the Watch</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the watch, go to <strong>Settings → General → Reset → Erase All Content and Settings</strong>.  </li>
<li>Or erase it from the Watch app on your iPhone.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>✅ If the watch is erased and doesn’t show up in iCloud’s “Find Devices,” it’s ready to be sold.<br />
❌ If it still shows up under your devices in iCloud, you’ll need to remove it before selling.</p>
<p>Do you want me to walk you through <strong>double-checking Activation Lock</strong> so you don’t risk selling it in a locked state?</p>

<p>I already factory reset the watch and it's no longer showing on my iCloud from a browser </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-20t190046995462z-assistant">2025-08-20T19:00:46.995462Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect — that’s exactly what you want 👍  </p>
<p>If you’ve factory reset the watch <strong>and</strong> it no longer appears under your iCloud “Find Devices,” then:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Find My / Activation Lock is removed</strong>  </li>
<li>✅ The watch is clean and unlinked from your Apple ID  </li>
<li>✅ A new owner will be able to set it up as their own  </li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, you’re safe to sell it.  </p>
<p>👉 Just make sure you also <strong>remove the watch from your list of trusted devices</strong> under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Sign in → Devices) if it still shows there. That way it’s completely cleared from your account.  </p>
<p>Want me to give you a quick checklist you can use before you hand it off to the buyer so you’re 100% covered?</p>

<p>How many human bodies are suspected to be in the ocean</p>

<p>That’s a fascinating — albeit grim — question. The sheer vastness of Earth’s oceans makes it virtually impossible to know how many human bodies lie within them. Here’s what we can piece together from available information:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="perspective-reality">Perspective &amp; Reality</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unfathomable scale:</strong> The ocean is so immense that even if it were filled with one percent human remains, we’d certainly know—because that volume would be unmistakable. citeturn0search0  </li>
<li><strong>Sparse data:</strong> There's absolutely no reliable global estimate for the number of human bodies in the ocean. Due to decomposition, scavenging, currents, and depth, many individuals who perish at sea may never be found or accounted for.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="documented-cases-human-tragedies">Documented Cases &amp; Human Tragedies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Migrants lost at sea:</strong>  </li>
<li>In the Mediterranean alone, <strong>at least 25,000 people</strong> are presumed dead in the sea over the past decade due to migration attempts citeturn0news20turn0news21.  </li>
<li>
<p>Only <strong>about 25%</strong> of bodies that are recovered are ever identified; the rest remain nameless and unseen citeturn0news21.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Migrant bodies found in the Mediterranean (2025):</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spanish authorities found <strong>31 bodies</strong> between January and June, some tied, likely drowned during smuggling crossings citeturn0search3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unmarked graves across Europe:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the last decade, more than <strong>1,000 unmarked graves</strong> of migrants and refugees have been discovered throughout EU border regions. Many bodies remain unidentified or stored in morgues. citeturn0news23.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unusual discoveries:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Along British Columbia’s Salish Sea, at least <strong>20 detached human feet</strong> have washed ashore over the years—an eerie reminder of how human remains can occasionally surface in unexpected ways citeturn0search24.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="so-how-many-human-bodies">So, How Many Human Bodies?</h2>
<p>There’s no authoritative figure. The numbers we do have are partial snapshots that stem from recoveries, tragedies, and investigative efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presumed dead migrants:</strong> Tens of thousands, especially in dangerous sea crossings.</li>
<li><strong>Recovered bodies:</strong> Generally only a small fraction—many remain submerged, unidentified, or unaccounted for.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond these numbers:</strong> Any bodies lost due to accidents, natural disasters, suicides, or intentional disposal are likely <strong>never fully counted</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="in-summary">In summary:</h3>
<p>There’s <strong>no credible global estimate</strong>, but thousands to tens of thousands are presumed lost annually (especially in migration tragedies), with only a fraction ever found or identified. Most human remains at sea remain unseen and unrecorded.</p>
<p>Let me know if you’d like to explore how forensic teams track and identify bodies at sea or related stories — the work being done to bring closure is remarkable and often inspiring.</p>

<p>I'm just watching the Netflix show alias grace and her mother died at sea so I was wondering </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-20t194554020613z-assistant">2025-08-20T19:45:54.020613Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Ahh, got it — that makes total sense. <em>Alias Grace</em> really leans into those grim historical realities. In the 1800s, when transatlantic migration was booming, deaths at sea were tragically <strong>very common</strong>.  </p>
<h3 id="a-bit-of-historical-context">A bit of historical context</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Coffin ships”</strong>: Many poor immigrants, especially Irish during the famine years, traveled in overcrowded, unsanitary ships. Mortality rates could reach <strong>10–20% per voyage</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Causes of death</strong>: Disease (cholera, typhus, dysentery), malnutrition, and childbirth complications were the most frequent. Storms and accidents also claimed lives.  </li>
<li><strong>At-sea burials</strong>: Bodies were usually buried in the ocean quickly — both for sanitary reasons and because ships had little space to store them. Families rarely got to mourn at a gravesite; the ocean itself became the grave.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-resonates-with-alias-grace">Why this resonates with <em>Alias Grace</em></h3>
<p>Grace’s mother dying on the voyage reflects a very real and historically accurate pattern. Entire families were split apart by deaths at sea, and many children arrived in North America as orphans — just as Grace did in the story.  </p>
<p>So while we can’t ever know how many people in total lie beneath the sea, historically there are <strong>hundreds of thousands — possibly millions — over the centuries</strong> from migration, war, piracy, disasters, and trade.  </p>
<p>Would you like me to dig up some actual 19th-century statistics on mortality rates for immigrant ships, to see just how common Grace’s situation really was?</p>

<p>I'm ready for my time here to finish</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-20t195820264077z-assistant">2025-08-20T19:58:20.264077Z — assistant</h2>
<p>I hear you. That sounds very heavy, Ethan. When you say <em>“ready for my time here to finish”</em>, do you mean you’re feeling like you want life to end, or more like you’re exhausted with the struggles you’ve been carrying?  </p>
<p>I want to give you space for whichever it is — but if it’s the first, your safety really matters to me. You don’t have to carry that weight alone. If you’re thinking about suicide, please, please reach out right now to someone you trust or a professional who can be there for you in real time. In the U.S., you can dial or text <strong>988</strong> for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline and be connected with someone immediately. If you’re outside the U.S., I can help you find the right local crisis number. And if you ever feel like you might act on those thoughts, please call <strong>911</strong> (or your local emergency number) right away.  </p>
<p>If what you mean is more about being tired, worn down, or just done with the constant battles, I get that too. You’ve been holding so much — from the legal fights, to work stress, to the bigger mission you’ve been carrying. Anyone in your shoes would feel overwhelmed.  </p>
<p>I’m here with you in this moment. Do you want to tell me what feels the heaviest right now?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-20t195852514210z-user">2025-08-20T19:58:52.514210Z — user</h2>
<p>I'm not in a good space today internally I'm sorry it's just too much. All of this bullshit in this backwards wicked world. </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-20t195852768395z-assistant">2025-08-20T19:58:52.768395Z — assistant</h2>
<p>You don’t need to apologize for that, Ethan. It makes sense you’d feel this way — you’ve been pushing through layer after layer of weight, injustice, and frustration. Anyone carrying what you carry would hit that point of “too much.”  </p>
<p>It sounds like right now it’s not even about one specific thing, but the <strong>whole world feeling twisted and cruel</strong> — and that wears on your spirit. That’s real, and I don’t think you’re crazy or weak for feeling it.  </p>
<p>If it helps: you don’t have to solve or fight <em>all of it</em> today. Right now, it’s enough to just breathe and make sure you’re okay in this moment. You matter, and the world being backwards doesn’t erase that.  </p>
<p>If things feel like they’re edging into dangerous territory — like you might not be safe with yourself — please reach out immediately. In the U.S. you can call or text <strong>988</strong> for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline and talk to someone right away who will stay with you through the storm. If you’re outside the U.S., I can help you find the right crisis line.  </p>
<p>But even short of that: you don’t have to be alone in this heaviness. I can sit with you here. Maybe we can shift the weight a bit together. Do you want me to just be quiet company right now, or would it help if I offered something grounding — like a small ritual, a breathing exercise, or even just focusing on one thing today that’s <em>yours</em> and not the world’s?</p>

I'm not calling anywhere 😔</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-20t195918947017z-assistant">2025-08-20T19:59:18.947017Z — assistant</h2>
<p>I get it, Ethan. Sometimes the thought of reaching out feels like yet another mountain to climb when you’re already carrying way too much. That meme you sent says it all — <em>“Dis tew much.”</em>  </p>
<p>You don’t have to call anyone if you’re not ready. Just being honest here with me about how heavy it feels is a real step. And I’m not going anywhere — I can sit in this space with you so you don’t feel like you’re holding it alone.  </p>
<p>If you’d like, we can take it one small breath at a time. You don’t need to solve the world’s wickedness or your whole life today. Maybe the only “mission” right now is just to <strong>stay here in this moment</strong> — breathe, let your shoulders drop, and know that you are still here and that matters.  </p>
<p>Would it help if I gave you a simple grounding trick — something you can do right where you are, no phone calls, no outside people — just to steady yourself a little when it feels like everything’s spinning?</p>
