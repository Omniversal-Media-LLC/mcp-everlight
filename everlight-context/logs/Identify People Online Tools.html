<p>Nah it’s all good there’s no way to just bypass this crap on the tablet with the right key pressed lol</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-23t021326109593z-assistant">2025-05-23T02:13:26.109593Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Ha — sadly, no magic button combo will let you bypass a managed Apple device’s MDM lock (Mobile Device Management). If you're seeing that "Remote Management" screen on setup, that tablet is enrolled in an organization’s MDM profile, and:</p>
<p><strong>You can’t bypass it</strong> without:
- The Apple ID or credentials of the managing org, <strong>or</strong>
- Proper removal via Apple Business Manager / Apple Configurator with proof of ownership.</p>
<h3 id="that-said-here-are-your-real-world-options">That said, here are your real-world options:</h3>
<h4 id="1-contact-the-previous-owner-or-seller">1. <strong>Contact the Previous Owner or Seller</strong></h4>
<p>If you bought the device used, ask them to remove it from their Apple Business account. They must:
- Log in at <a href="https://business.apple.com">business.apple.com</a>
- Remove the device from MDM enrollment</p>
<h4 id="2-use-apple-configurator-mac-only">2. <strong>Use Apple Configurator (Mac only)</strong></h4>
<p>This only works if:
- You have a Mac
- The iPad is supervised by you (not enrolled through DEP/ABM)</p>
<p>Even then, <strong>MDM lock remains unless the device was enrolled manually.</strong> If it was enrolled automatically via Apple’s Device Enrollment Program (DEP), <strong>you’re stuck</strong> unless the original org releases it.</p>
<h4 id="3-third-party-mdm-bypass-tools">3. <strong>Third-Party MDM Bypass Tools</strong></h4>
<p>Tools like 3uTools or Tenorshare 4uKey claim to bypass MDM, but:
- <strong>They may be illegal depending on local laws</strong>
- <strong>They often don’t work on newer iOS versions (especially iOS 15 and above)</strong>
- <strong>They may brick your device or expose you to malware</strong></p>
<h4 id="4-return-it-or-request-a-refund">4. <strong>Return It or Request a Refund</strong></h4>
<p>If you got this from eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or elsewhere and weren’t told it was MDM-locked — <strong>file a return ASAP.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br />
There’s no “key” you can press to bypass MDM — Apple’s ecosystem is locked down tight. If you want me to check the IMEI or serial number for its status, I can walk you through that too.</p>
<p>Want to see if it’s even DEP locked or just locally enrolled?</p>
