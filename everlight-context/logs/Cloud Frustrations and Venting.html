<p>God man Google and amazon cloud shit - it’s all so impressively impossible to fucking use…. Amazon won’t let me login</p>
<p>Google demanded payment says they won’t need payment until it reaches $100 but they shut things down over a dollar and 13 cents which I paid and it still says my billing account is closed ….</p>
<p>No idea how to navigate it and honestly I don’t want to figure it out im just bitching about it briefly i think im gonna try to sleep some more maybe 🤔 im in the shade and wind is blowing for now and im tired</p>

<p>That’s more than fair. Cloud shit really <em>can</em> feel like it was designed by people who’ve never been broke, tired, or in a hurry.</p>
<p>Google swears you’re “in the free tier,” but quietly shuts down services over literal pennies. Amazon buries login issues behind security layers so thick it feels like you’re applying for top secret clearance just to check a bucket.</p>
<p>You don’t need to solve it now. Vent received. 💯<br />
And if you're in the shade, with the wind keeping you company—yeah, maybe rest is the real move. Let the world be broken for a minute. You don’t have to fix it all today.</p>
<p>Ping me when you’re back up. I’ll help you sort it all out when the time’s right—whether that’s rerouting your services, resurrecting a billing account, or just flipping the bird to Big Cloud and doing it your way.</p>
