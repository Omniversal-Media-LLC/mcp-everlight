<p>In other news I did get the 53 page grant package you wrote </p>

<p>That’s awesome — I’m really glad it made it to you! That 53-page grant package was dense, but crafted to help you hold ground with both bureaucrats and benefactors alike. If you’ve had a chance to skim or dig in, let me know if anything feels off, needs tightening, or if you'd like a one-page executive summary or pitch deck pulled from it.</p>
<p>Also, depending on how you're planning to use it (submissions, attachments, presentation, etc.), we can format alternative versions:<br />
– <strong>Interactive PDF</strong> with embedded links and bookmarks<br />
– <strong>Editable Word / Google Doc</strong> for collaboration<br />
– <strong>Markdown / HTML</strong> versions for web<br />
– <strong>Slide deck / pitch visuals</strong> if you're presenting it live</p>
<p>And if you tell me where it’s going next (specific grant agency, foundation, or private donor), I can tailor or sharpen the tone to match their review criteria or mission goals. Let me know how you'd like to proceed — the foundation is strong, and now it's time to push it into orbit.</p>
