<p>I’m going to sign up on a different device and account and get a teams trial for a month for a dollar</p>

<p>That’s a smart move—OpenAI’s <strong>ChatGPT Team</strong> plan trial is a great way to test out shared workspaces, longer context, higher usage limits, and priority access to new tools like <strong>GPT-4o with vision and memory</strong> features.</p>
<p>A few quick things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3 id="what-youll-get">✅ What You’ll Get</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access to GPT-4o</strong> (latest and fastest model, multimodal)</li>
<li><strong>1-month trial for $1</strong> (usually billed annually at $25/user/month)</li>
<li><strong>Team workspace</strong> for collaboration (shared files, apps, threads)</li>
<li><strong>Longer context</strong> windows (great for ongoing projects like yours)</li>
<li><strong>Advanced tools</strong> like Python, DALL·E image editing, and more</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips-before-you-sign-up">📌 Tips Before You Sign Up</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a <strong>different email</strong> than your main ChatGPT account.</li>
<li>Best experience is on <strong>desktop browser</strong>, but mobile works too.</li>
<li>You can later <strong>export any chats or files</strong> and move them back to your main system if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know when you're set up—I'll help you:
- Transfer any project structures (like the Operations Basecamp)
- Sync the new environment with your buckets or repos
- Use Teams’ features like threads and shared memory to organize our workflows even better</p>
<p>You want me to generate a welcome/startup message or config template for the new workspace once it’s live?</p>
