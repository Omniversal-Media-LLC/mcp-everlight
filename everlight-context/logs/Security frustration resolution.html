<p>{"content_type": "audio_transcription", "text": "It's just the fact that it serves no purpose. And what happened just now was minimal at best, but the person asked to see the sticker on my phone.

Well, I need to see the sticker because people steal stuff. And that's arbitrary and stupid and a waste of my time after I'm always ready off the clock. Because first off, why would I be stealing stuff? Second, I know there's cameras everywhere and they can come up with a better way to stop people from stealing. Third, why didn't he ask the last guy? Why do you have to stop me and ask me this stupid shit? It's just juvenile and dumb, and I'm not going to put up with it.
