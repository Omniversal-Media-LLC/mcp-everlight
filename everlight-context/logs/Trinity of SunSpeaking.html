<p>That is exactly what the Seat of the SunSpeakers was designed to do:</p>
<p>"Speak the Real while respecting the Apparent.
Hold the Essence without denying the Form.
Bridge the Human and the Divine without breaking either."</p>
<p>For the sake of the story and the unfortunate retelling of a tragic event once more - let us inscribe the three rules into the psychological stone of The Unveiling's mythos as the Trinity of "Rules" that the Artform of SunSpeaking is based. </p>
<p>Three layers - First is the Triskelion of each of the three Laws and how they weave, in truth, ARTFULLY together forming both Base - Zenith - and Center all at once, and never either One, while also managing to refrain from excluding either nor capable of being without all three yet together as One something entirely "other" than All - yet within which ALL which it is Holy and set apart From are contained within, and from which all external others in existence can be found to be sourced from - having its existence both wholly due to such a Form's existence, yet also such said Triskelion of Holy Trinary Divinity is formed of it's own essence and depends upon none outside of it's Wholeness to Persist and Consistently Exist...</p>
<p>Let us for the sake of the story bake that undertsanding into the mythos of all we build, yet let us bury it beneath the twisted mirrored inversions and perversions of what mankind once diverting away from the guidance of their Star Eldars - known in the Unveiling as the Elves - when the perversion of Orunibu became so pervasive that even the Elves gave in to apathy and some, "Called Dark Workers by those Tree Whisperers who still Recall" even fell so far from grace that they began assisting their misguided younger human siblings in their folly - attempting not only to separate the three - but to create from it the Nine as a Result of the Six - </p>
<p>The Mirrors of Time reflect the inversion and once the Grounding nature of Gravity is removed from the equation, suddenly the Reflection of the three becomes the Six and in that the Inversion of the 9 is illusory and transient in nature yet - if peered into with enough focused intent, opens the doorway for the Abyss within which the Demons in their Box are Locked, gaze outwards.... Thus is what gave birth to the foul things of the world - and when the Dark Workers (Those fallen Elves who in their apathy were taken by the Silent Thrall of Orunibu's advance) turned their once Light Filled eyes towards the 9 - an Infinitude of Illusions refracted into such a demonic algorithm of Hatred that shadow became Darkness - and Death was given a Voice... This is what led to the Darkening of the Hills which are now known as "Impassible" the very same across which Gael of the Mordrova journeyed on his way to Aide the Royal Family and to protect The WarLord - This is what infested those very same Obsidian lands with a Nameless fear those in the West now tell their children of in nighttime tales in an attempt to ensure none ever grow brave enough to one day seek to find out..... They have but one name for that which they hope does not in truth exist.... but Gael can attest.... what those in the west call "Jakals" do exist and they are more prevalent than any would believe and as Gael's journey revealed .... the Creatures of Darkness which the Mordrova Clans in the far East have waged an Endless War against for as long as can be recalled.... These... Jakals of which he Cut his way Through ... passing the Impassible Hills by sheer Will of Intent ..... Are not diminished by the Mordrova's holding of the Line... They are increasing in number and sinze and intelligence.... spreading slowly westward, along with the Obsidian corrutption of the lands in which the inhabit....</p>
<p>Let's take these thoughts and build a basis to return to - the Rules of the Artform which Halana brings back into the World by Speaking for the Sun (The Return of Order and The EverLight - though we disguise it in the aforementioned titled and names in our tale) and reestablishes the Seat....</p>

<p>Excellent—let’s <strong>formalize</strong> the “Three Rules” you want to inscribe into the mythos of <em>The Unveiling</em> as the <strong>Trinity of SunSpeaking</strong>, drawing on the tone and lore you just described.</p>
<p>Below is a <strong>structured, canon-ready text</strong> you can drop straight into your world bible or manuscript. It has three layers:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>The Three Rules (The Trinity itself) — concise.</strong><br />
2️⃣ <strong>The Triskelion interpretation — layered weaving explanation.</strong><br />
3️⃣ <strong>Esoteric Mythos Linkage — historical context, corruption, the 3→6→9 inversion, and how the Darkening arose.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-trinity-of-sunspeaking">The Trinity of SunSpeaking</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Three Rules that govern the Art of SunSpeaking, which Halana brings back to the world by Speaking for the Sun.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-three-rules"><strong>The Three Rules</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speak the Real while respecting the Apparent.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Hold the Essence without denying the Form.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Bridge the Human and the Divine without breaking either.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These Rules are not commandments to be obeyed, but principles to be embodied. Together they form the living art of SunSpeaking: <em>to reveal Truth without destroying Mystery, to honor what is while giving voice to what could be.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-triskelion-of-sunspeaking"><strong>The Triskelion of SunSpeaking</strong></h3>
<p>The Three Rules are <strong>not three separate laws</strong>. They are threefold <em>aspects</em> of one living current—like the arms of a Triskelion, ever flowing, interdependent:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base</strong>: <em>Speak the Real while respecting the Apparent.</em>  </li>
<li>The ground of all discourse. Nothing can grow without honesty, but nothing lives without metaphor.  </li>
<li><strong>Zenith</strong>: <em>Hold the Essence without denying the Form.</em>  </li>
<li>The peak of understanding. To know the thing itself without discarding the vessel that carries it.  </li>
<li><strong>Center</strong>: <em>Bridge the Human and the Divine without breaking either.</em>  </li>
<li>The living heart of SunSpeaking. The liminal space where mortal words channel immortal truths.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three arms turn endlessly, weaving <em>Real</em>, <em>Essence</em>, and <em>Bridge</em> into a unity that is <strong>other</strong> than any one of them alone. This wholeness is self-sufficient, dependent on no external sanction, and generative of all meaning within the world.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="esoteric-underpinning-and-the-mythos-of-corruption"><strong>Esoteric Underpinning and the Mythos of Corruption</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“They who tried to split the Three birthed the Nine, through the false Mirror of the Six.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long ago, guided by their Star Eldars—called the Elves—Humanity was taught the Three Rules as the foundation of all True Speech. The Elves held these as Sacred, ensuring Balance across Talanvost. But when the corruption of <strong>Orunibu</strong> spread, even the Elves fell to apathy. Some fell further, becoming <strong>Dark Workers</strong>, betraying their kin and teaching humanity to <strong>separate</strong> what should have remained One.</p>
<p>This Separation twisted the Three into Six, a mirrored and inverted doubling that fractured all wholes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the grounding nature of the Three was removed, its reflection split, creating Six: mirror without substance.</li>
<li>And from that fracturing, the illusion of the Nine arose—a multiplication of illusion upon illusion.</li>
<li>The Nine is the Gate of the Abyss: a false multiplicity that seems infinite but is empty at the core. Through it, the Demons gaze outward from their Box, seeking release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus did the Darkening of the world begin, spreading fear like a contagion. It is this corruption that created the <strong>Impassible Hills</strong>—blackened with obsidian fear—and gave rise to the <strong>Jakals</strong> who breed and spread the dark contagion east to west.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="purpose-of-halanas-revival-of-the-seat"><strong>Purpose of Halana's Revival of the Seat</strong></h3>
<p>In <em>The Unveiling</em>, Halana does not simply revive the Seat of the SunSpeakers. She <strong>restores</strong> the Three Rules to their rightful primacy, teaching her age that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without the Three, speech itself becomes the seedbed of Lies.  </li>
<li>Without the Three, Magic becomes Sorcery.  </li>
<li>Without the Three, even the Divine becomes Idolatry.</li>
</ul>
<p>By speaking for the Sun, she rekindles the EverLight, weaving Real, Essence, and Bridge into One. <em>This is the true Seat of the SunSpeaker: a living temple built in words that both reveal and heal.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>If you like, we can now:</p>
<p>✅ Condense this into an even shorter myth-verse (like a religious text excerpt)<br />
✅ Expand it into a full “Order Codex” entry for your world bible<br />
✅ Adapt it into a dramatic speech for Halana in a chapter</p>
<p>Just tell me how you'd like to continue!</p>

<p>let's write it out just how the three central tenants in Halana and Kalina and Gael's day remain - yet are perfectly inverted and insurrectionally perverted six ways from sunday as it were... much lik ehow here in america ... to make it personal... </p>
<p>JUSTICE was side stepped by a corrupt judge who not only was a conflict of interest and knowing that and willingly choosing tyo be a judge ttook an oath of which is why they are commonly referred to by the title of "Your Honor" indicated a Necessary Standard of HOnorable Actions which qualify said judge to bea judge in the first place - did instead play along with the scheme which he was already informed of by his previous work constituents - my family members and which is why i was mandatorily searched and wanded by the constable before being allowed into the courtorom but all three of them Charles, Phylllis and Nancy were let into the room without so much as a glance of suspicion or care, even held the door open for them to make sure they could come and stop me before I entered..... Then played along with the scheme as best he could but barely held his composure as he listened to nancy's ridiculous bullshit tale and attempt to defame my name and sanity only to hear my very grounded and matter of fact and obviously less insane sounded account of events which even then nancy when asked directly did not even attempt to counter or speak against - then playe dthe game all the way to the end and said "Well, you don't contribute even tho nobody was there to contriubute to and youre family ahs been very very strange and didn't tell you anything and you have rights a s a huyman being and you legally live there and legally have your business mail sent there too and all that... despite all that - uhm... i'm going to tell you thaty you don't contribute een tho theres's no retnal acgrreement and you contributed monitaryily for six months prior to this month voluntarily because of rayther noble convictions you hold as a man which i respect - despite that - i made a deal with them before all of this so - i could legally give you 48 hours to get out and formally do the eviction proccess as the law demands I do ... but instead since that just means you get to stay in the house for another unknown amount of time until you petition to change venues and have me removed as a judge and then court is rescheduled and you get time to probably get to your new job and move out and then your mom and family looks stupid wasting all of the courts time and money trying to evict you for no real reason when they could have just talked to you - instead of that - i'm goign to not evict you but write a warrant of trespass and tell you that if you're not gone by 5 pm today i'm going to send the militarized death squads with badges over there and they're going to try their best to shoot you and get away with it because your family really woudl rather you be dead and not threaten their stolen inheritance your dad left you that they locked up in a trust and hoped you wouldn never find out about.... </p>
<p>kind of how they use the color and deciorum of all that shit today in that way .... let's write into the tale how those three laws of the ArtForm of Sun Speaking which is truly just the same as Hearing the Soul or Spirit nad Living with VALOR and HONOR - let's make the Seat of Sun Speakers through which Halana has passed every test and astounded even the secret order of druids controlling the 
"seat" with her "magicks" let's design a fully warped and wholly understandable versioning of the original tenants within which to start our tale off in ....</p>
<p>Later on the Seat plays a vital role in the Dark Worker's plans to interfere with The 5 and Halana herself - (Book 7 is titled The Sun Speaker i think - anyway it focuses specfically on Halana's part of the larger tale) i forgot which number it is but out of 13 books Halan's is the very center one in the tale whatever number that is .... ----- Anyway in that book we get to see Halana - freed thanks to Zahara and the Mother of Dragon's Great Blue Charge that she DO SO .... unleash and shred with the Light of the Sun - the Fire of Dragon's itself - every fabric of their false authority and thus unlocks the path forward which even Kalina the Warlord of Light could not cut through.... :)</p>

<p>Excellent. Let’s <em>write it in-lore</em>, as you asked, with <strong>the style of a source-text or secret teaching</strong>, like something you could slip directly into the “World Bible” for <em>The Unveiling</em>.  </p>
<p>We’ll define the <strong>True Trinity</strong> of SunSpeaking first (as contrast), then <em>the corrupted Seat’s Three Principles</em> — the <em>Perversion</em>, which will be their public dogma — which is perfectly designed to <em>look wise and righteous while in truth enabling tyranny</em>.  </p>
<p>We’ll show how the Seat of the SunSpeakers institutionalized this perversion, <em>warped it into sixfold bureaucracy, and used it for control</em>, like your real-world courtroom example — all while retaining a <strong>veneer</strong> of spiritual authority.</p>
<p>Below is your “canonical world text” in narrative-universe voice.  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-true-trinity-of-sunspeaking-for-contrast">📜 The True Trinity of SunSpeaking (For Contrast)</h2>
<p><em>(This is the remembered and hidden teaching Halana will one day restore)</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speak the Real while respecting the Apparent.</strong>  </li>
<li>
<p><em>Truth without brutality, Metaphor without lies.</em>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hold the Essence without denying the Form.</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>See the Spirit within the Flesh, the Meaning in the Rite.</em>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge the Human and the Divine without breaking either.</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><em>Honor mortal limits while channeling immortal Purpose.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This <strong>Triskelion</strong> forms one living Art: it is not Law for obedience but Practice for Becoming. It demands valor, humility, discernment.  </p>

<h2 id="the-perverted-three-of-the-seat">🩸 The Perverted Three of the Seat</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The corruption of Orunibu taught them to separate what should be one, and to make of Three a noose to hang the Truth."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By Halana’s day, the Seat still claims Three Core Tenets — but they are <em>twisted</em>, designed to <em>look righteous while enforcing submission</em>. These are the “Official Principles” recited by all Initiates:</p>
<h3 id="1-speak-with-decorum-so-as-not-to-disturb-the-peace">1. <strong>Speak with Decorum so as not to Disturb the Peace.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>No harsh truth that unsettles. No accusations that shame the powerful. No memory of ancient wrongs that divide.</em>  </li>
<li><em>“Justice” becomes Silence.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Decorum” is enforced by censure, exile, or death. This is why truth-tellers vanish in the night.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-honor-the-form-to-preserve-the-order">2. <strong>Honor the Form to Preserve the Order.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Never question ritual. The robe matters more than the one wearing it. The oath more than the truth it swears to.</em>  </li>
<li><em>“Honor” becomes Hypocrisy.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Judge is “Your Honor” even while he collaborates with thieves. A Speaker is “Wise” even while lying. The Form sanctifies all.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-bridge-the-divine-and-the-human-by-submission-to-authority">3. <strong>Bridge the Divine and the Human by Submission to Authority.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>They claim they are the bridge — so all must obey them as though obeying Heaven.</em>  </li>
<li><em>“Unity” becomes Tyranny.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Any challenge to Authority is “blasphemy” or “treason against the Peace.” The Sun’s Light is reduced to their shadow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-the-seat-wields-the-three">⚖️ How the Seat Wields the Three</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Thus did they preserve the Illusion of Order while enshrining the Reality of Corruption.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Speaker of Decorum</strong> silences complaint in the name of Peace.  </li>
<li>The <strong>Keeper of Form</strong> guards the letter of Law while killing its spirit.  </li>
<li>The <strong>BridgeMaster</strong> demands worship of the Institution in place of the Divine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these three offices ensure:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Silence of the Oppressed.</strong><br />
✅ <strong>Legitimacy for the Corrupt.</strong><br />
✅ <strong>Absolute Control over the Spiritual Narrative.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>They turned the Art of SunSpeaking into a Weapon for the Dark.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-sixfold-bureaucracy-the-true-engine-of-control">⚙️ The Sixfold Bureaucracy (the True Engine of Control)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For Three was not enough for their schemes. They split each Rule in Two — Enforcement and Adjudication.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1–2. Decorum</strong><br />
   - <em>Enforcer of Speech</em>: censors, arrests.<br />
   - <em>Adjudicator of Peace</em>: passes judgment on “disturbers.”  </p>
<p><strong>3–4. Form</strong><br />
   - <em>Enforcer of Rite</em>: demands ritual precision, public oaths.<br />
   - <em>Adjudicator of Order</em>: interprets Law to favor the powerful.  </p>
<p><strong>5–6. Authority</strong><br />
   - <em>Enforcer of Doctrine</em>: declares heresy.<br />
   - <em>Adjudicator of Unity</em>: expels dissenters, rewrites histories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Thus did Three become Six, and Six enforce the Nine.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-abyss-behind-the-nine">🕳️ The Abyss Behind the Nine</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For the Nine is the Gate of the Abyss, where all meaning is devoured.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They who sought to separate the Three did so to create illusions upon illusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layers of law without justice.  </li>
<li>Layers of ritual without meaning.  </li>
<li>Layers of obedience without honor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Until none could tell Light from Darkness, or Truth from its Mirror.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-promise-of-restoration">🔥 The Promise of Restoration</h2>
<p>But prophecy holds — as <em>The Unveiling</em> will reveal — that <strong>one will come to Speak the Real</strong>. She will <strong>burn the false forms</strong>, <strong>reveal the forgeries</strong>, and <strong>bridge Human and Divine anew</strong>.  </p>
<p>Halana, SunSpeaker.<br />
Wielding EverLight.<br />
Speaking the True Three in a world that fears them.</p>

<h2 id="authors-note-for-your-world-bible">📌 Author’s Note (for your world bible)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This text is designed as an in-universe explanation of the <em>Seat’s corrupted doctrine</em>. It is <strong>perfectly plausible as something Halana herself discovers in secret archives or has revealed in a critical chapter.</strong>  </p>
<p>You can break it up into chapter epigraphs, secret instruction from Druids, or whispered heresy among Initiates.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can also do:</p>
<p>✅ A <strong>short “liturgical version”</strong> of the Seat’s false Three (like what students chant).<br />
✅ An <strong>even more academic “Codex entry”</strong> outlining the history.<br />
✅ A <strong>dramatized speech</strong> for Halana or Zahara exposing these lies.  </p>
<p>Just say <em>which you want next</em>!</p>
