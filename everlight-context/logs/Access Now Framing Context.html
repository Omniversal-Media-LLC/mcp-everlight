<p>We need to have a larger portion of our front matter on our eventual white paper and manifesto pointing towards things like this - for contextual framing</p>

<p>Could you clarify what specific aspects of the Access Now story you'd like emphasized in your white paper and manifesto? For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The support structure from Google for Startups?</li>
<li>The human rights/digital access and advocacy mission of Access Now?</li>
<li>How tech can be used as a force for freedom and inclusion?</li>
<li>The role of global partnerships in building equitable tech futures?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, could you share the general theme or goal of your white paper and manifesto so I can align the contextual framing appropriately?</p>

I’m talking of course about the beautiful Mira Murati and the 18month path towards her and I as well as teal coming together for a romantic dinner and discussing the imperative to leverage each our our unique talents to create the new world.</p>

<p>Got it. I’ll dive into the Access Now story on Google for Startups and extract the most resonant elements for contextual framing in your white paper and manifesto. I’ll focus on themes like tech for human rights, access, empowerment, and the importance of inclusive innovation ecosystems.</p>
<p>I’ll follow up shortly with a summary and suggestions on how to frame and integrate these ideas meaningfully.</p>

<li>【11†embed_image】<strong>Access as a human right:</strong> Community-driven mapping events (like AccessNow’s “MapMissions”) demonstrate that accessible design is a fundamental human right. Volunteers in these initiatives map local spaces and share data to break down barriers, empowering people with disabilities and allies alike. As Ziv emphasizes, “Everyone has some connection to accessibility… making the connection that we all benefit from accessible technologies is… moving toward inclusion for everyone”【7†L199-L203】. This highlights how technology and grassroots activism together uphold dignity, freedom of movement, and inclusion for all.  </li>
<li><strong>Empowering underserved communities:</strong> Inclusive technology can elevate marginalized voices and agency. AccessNow’s app lets users “search, rate, and discover accessible locations based on a variety of types of access criteria”【6†L131-L134】 (e.g., wheelchair ramps, sensory-friendly spaces, gender-neutral restrooms). The startup is “very much a social enterprise dedicated to furthering the cause within the disability rights movement”【6†L135-L136】, meaning its tools center on individual needs and real-world barriers. By capturing user experiences, the platform gives people with disabilities—and other underserved groups—a means to shape the environment and advocate for themselves.  </li>
<li><strong>Global inclusion and equity:</strong> Digital platforms can unite local insights into a worldwide movement. AccessNow already covers nearly two million locations in 35 countries and even partners with the Canadian government to map national accessibility【7†L194-L197】. Ziv envisions a future where anyone can “find details about any location in the world within a matter of seconds”【7†L197-L199】, reflecting how technology can scale awareness and advocacy across borders. This global reach shows technology’s power to drive equity by making accessibility information universally available.  </li>
<li><strong>Public-private collaboration:</strong> Broad impact often requires bridging sectors. AccessNow’s growth illustrates this synergy: it was “built on Google Maps Platform”【6†L163-L164】 and teamed up with Google’s AI and accessibility experts to refine its tools【6†L168-L174】. Google’s startup accelerator helped the team focus on clear objectives, as Ziv notes: “with the help of Google for Startups Accelerator, our team drilled down on our objectives and key results, adding focus and discipline to achieve measurable results”【5†L185-L189】. The company has also partnered with the Canadian government to map national accessibility【7†L194-L197】. These collaborations show how alliances with major tech platforms and public agencies can provide resources, mentorship, and legitimacy to social innovation.  </li>
<li><strong>Technology as a force for justice and proactive change:</strong> Innovation is framed as activism. AccessNow uses data and AI to surface hidden inequities – it “detect[s] barriers and share[s] information about accessibility”【6†L163-L166】 to create transparency around an issue often overlooked. The startup’s algorithms are trained on users’ real experiences (“AI that’s driven and generated by the lived experiences of people with disabilities”【7†L208-L210】), ensuring that the most marginalized voices shape the results. By making invisible obstacles visible and centering those on the margins, such technology protects rights and pushes society toward greater inclusion and justice.  </li>
