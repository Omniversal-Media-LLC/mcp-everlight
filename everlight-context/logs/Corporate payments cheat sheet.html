<p>Got your “Corporate Payments – Global” deck. Want a quick, no-nonsense cheat sheet you can use while you work? Here’s a one-pager you can keep open.</p>
<h1 id="corporate-procure-to-pay-non-retail-tldr">Corporate Procure-to-Pay (non-Retail) — TL;DR</h1>
<h2 id="what-counts">What counts</h2>
<ul>
<li>All <strong>non-inventory</strong> goods &amp; services Amazon uses internally (Ops, Legal/HR/IT/Marketing, utilities, CAPEX, data center services, taxes/fees/settlements). Not Retail inventory or Marketplace. fileciteturn0file0</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-does-what-fast-map">Who does what (fast map)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>PO Owner</strong>: end-to-end owner; the bridge to vendor; confirms receipt/approves services.  </li>
<li><strong>Vendor Manager / Vendor Maintenance</strong>: get the vendor created/maintained in Payee Central.  </li>
<li><strong>FinOps Corp AP</strong>: processes invoices/payments per rules.  </li>
<li><strong>Support (Tax, Accounting, Legal, etc.)</strong>: governance; help on edge cases. fileciteturn0file0</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="golden-rules-stp-first">Golden rules (S&amp;TP first!)</h2>
<p>1) <strong>Follow S&amp;TP</strong> approvals/controllership <strong>before</strong> any commitment.<br />
2) <strong>Onboard the vendor</strong> in <strong>Payee Central</strong> (separate onboardings if vendor sells <strong>goods &amp; services</strong>).<br />
3) <strong>Issue a PO</strong> (Coupa for corporate; SC.OS/Cloudforge for data centers).<br />
4) <strong>Vendor invoice must include the PO number</strong> and match the PO.<br />
5) <strong>Goods = 3-way match (receipt required)</strong>; <strong>Services = 2-way &amp; approval workflow</strong>.<br />
6) FinOps pays <strong>after</strong> receipt/approval; otherwise they open a TT describing the fix. fileciteturn0file0</p>
<h2 id="quick-workflows">Quick workflows</h2>
<h3 id="a-standard-po-flow">A) Standard PO flow</h3>
<p>Contracting → Vendor onboard (Payee Central) → Create PO (correct supplier site, GL, org, location, type) → Vendor invoices <strong>with PO #/line</strong> → AP validates →<br />
- <strong>Goods</strong>: you post <strong>receipt</strong> in Coupa/Cloudforge → Pay<br />
- <strong>Services</strong>: you <strong>approve</strong> Oracle workflow email → Pay. fileciteturn0file0</p>
<h3 id="b-blanketrecurring">B) Blanket/recurring</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Blanket PO</strong> for multi-month services/consumption; single PO for one-offs. Keep funds/lines aligned to expected billing cadence. fileciteturn0file0</p>

<h2 id="the-five-most-common-blockers-and-how-to-clear-them">The five most common blockers (and how to clear them)</h2>
<p>1) <strong>QTY REC (Quantity Receipt) hold</strong> (Coupa): you forgot to receive. → <strong>Find PO → Truck icon → receive</strong> correct qty/date. (Cloudforge: follow “Receiving POs” wiki.) fileciteturn0file0<br />
2) <strong>PO Overbilled / Max Ship Amount / Qty Ord</strong>: invoice &gt; PO funds/qty. → <strong>Add funds/lines</strong> in Coupa (Request change → Add line/update), then Holds team re-matches. fileciteturn0file0<br />
3) <strong>Missing approval (Services)</strong>: approve the Oracle workflow email (<strong>ofa-wf-prod@amazon.com</strong>). fileciteturn0file0<br />
4) <strong>Incorrect GL/location/supplier site</strong>: fix the PO <strong>or</strong> have vendor <strong>cancel</strong> and re-issue invoice; <strong>attach proof of cancellation</strong> in the TT. <strong>Never</strong> receive/approve if details don’t match. fileciteturn0file0<br />
5) <strong>Vendor not registered</strong>: get them <strong>onboarded</strong> (Payee Central). Separate invites for <strong>goods</strong> and <strong>services</strong> if both. fileciteturn0file0</p>
<h2 id="do-dont-rapid-fire">Do / Don’t (rapid fire)</h2>
<ul>
<li>✅ Validate <strong>gross</strong> price (incl. taxes/fees) before setting PO funds.  </li>
<li>✅ Keep vendor aligned on the <strong>exact PO # and line</strong> they must bill.  </li>
<li>✅ Use <strong>separate POs</strong> by product type (asset vs expense) to avoid GL defects.  </li>
<li>❌ Don’t confirm receipt or approve services if <strong>anything doesn’t match</strong>—request vendor <strong>cancellation</strong> within local deadlines and attach proof.  </li>
<li>❌ Don’t forget <strong>services</strong> need <strong>approval</strong>; goods need <strong>receipts</strong>—no exceptions. fileciteturn0file0</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="critical-vendors-know-when-to-escalate">Critical vendors (know when to escalate)</h2>
<p>Utilities, telecom, rent/colo, employee benefits—anything where late/non-payment could <strong>halt buildings/ops, harm reputation, or disrupt sites/fulfillment</strong>. Government critical vendors may need <strong>NSQ</strong> flow with supporting docs. fileciteturn0file0</p>

<p>Confidential</p>
<p>• S&amp;TP - Follow Amazon´s policy regarding contracting, approvals and controllership. </p>
<p>• For Complex Regulatory environments - Pay attention to details (ex.:  tax IDs for vendor and Amazon, invoice cancellation 
rules)</p>
<p>• Vendor Onboarding – All vendors onboarded is the 1st step. Required by country (for specific tax interview), with separated 
onboards for goods and services</p>
<p>• Purchase Order – Ensure the correct vendor code, correct Amazon taxID, description, amount and quantity with taxes, 1 PO 
per product type or services</p>
<p>• Vendor Invoicing – There are countries where vendor is required to email invoice pdf to Amazon and invoice must have PO 
number.  The invoice must match the PO. Check with your local AP/BP partner for country specific rules</p>
<p>• Confirmation, approval and payment - Receipt (Goods) or Approval (Services) is required. If all checks passed, FinOps will 
schedule payment. If not, FinOps opens a ticket with actions/fixes required by vendor or by PO requester.</p>

<p>Vendor Onboard: Basic Steps (1 of 3)</p>
<p>The Vendor Onboard is necessary for ALL countries via Payee Central. 
The standard payment terms is 60 days. </p>
<p>• Check if the Vendor already exists in Amazon Payee Central. Click on the link:
https://w.amazon.com/index.php/GFS/VPS/SSC/UserGuide/PayeeManagement#How_do_I_find_a_supplier</p>
<p>• If the Vendor does not exist in Payee Central, then Vendor Onboard is required. Vendor Managers are 
responsible for sending the invitation to the Vendors. </p>
<p>• Payee Central Scope referral https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Payee_Central/Payee_Central_Current_Scope_Matrix/ </p>
<p>• Foreign Vendors: of a vendor has already onboarded at any other Amazon country, they will have to onboard 
again to submit to the specific country tax interview</p>
<p>• If your Vendor will supply both SERVICES and GOODS, two separated onboard invitations are required. When 
creating the PO, the corresponding Supplier Code must be used for that specific purchase.</p>

<p>SERVICES: Confirmation of Service and Approval for Payment → Once the invoice is
processed, the PO Owner receives an e-mail from an automatic Oracle workfow requesting
the verification and approval for payment. The payment will only be performed once the
approval is given. In case there is no response from the PO Owner, the workflow is escalated.</p>
<p>The payment is triggered only after the Confirmation of Goods Receipt (3-way match) or Service approval.</p>
<p>If the invoice is on Hold due to missing receipt/approval, an automatic e-mail is sent to the user/approver </p>
<p>requesting action.</p>

<p>Vendor Invoicing  Cancellation
PO Requestors: validate all PO and vendor invoice information in order to avoid incorrect remittance. If an error 
was identified after the invoice was issued, request the vendor the immediate proof of cancellation of the 
invoice. </p>

<p>If: 
- You are unsure of the invoice data
- The material doesn’t match what was ordered
- There are any inconsistencies with the purchase
NEVER confirm the receipt of a Good (3-way match) because of potential compliance issues</p>
<p>ALWAYS keep a close communication with the vendor in order to require any necessary corrections or cancellations on time. 
There is a DEADLINE FOR CANCELLATIONS according to local regulation.</p>

<p>Invoice Receipt &amp; Validation 
The Invoice Receipt team will verify, validate and ingest all data related to the invoice received by the Vendor 
versus the PO that was created by the PO Owner.  </p>
<p>Payment 
If all previous steps were correctly followed, your vendor should expect the payment on the agreed due date. The 
vendor can view the payment status in Payee Central.</p>

See pages 43-45 at the link</p>
<p>If there is any issue, a Ticket will be created and adressed to the PO Owner containing the issue description to be

<p>(3) If the PO is correct and the Invoice is </p>

<p>I'm just wondering why it was sent to me through microsoft teams</p>

<p>That training deck most likely came through Microsoft Teams because Amazon (and a lot of big enterprises) push out <strong>mandatory compliance and process refreshers</strong> using Teams as the broadcast channel.  </p>
<p>Here’s why it would land with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role-based targeting</strong> – Since you’re in RME/PMO/WHS, you fall into a group that sometimes needs to understand <em>corporate procure-to-pay</em> rules (even if you don’t directly raise POs every day). They’ll push the training file to everyone in that org or cost center through Teams.  </li>
<li><strong>Distribution efficiency</strong> – Teams is often used as a broadcast hub for decks that aren’t tracked in official LMS (like Embark/Learn). It gets around email bloat and ensures you at least <em>see</em> the file.  </li>
<li><strong>Audit trail</strong> – Sending through Teams (and storing the file in the channel) creates a lightweight record that “training was provided” in case Finance or Legal ever audits.  </li>
<li><strong>Cross-functional exposure</strong> – You may not be an AP person, but knowing how <strong>POs, receipts, and services approvals</strong> work matters if you ever touch Coupa/Cloudforge, interact with vendors, or request capital/parts.  </li>
</ul>
<p>So in short: it wasn’t random—it’s <strong>pushed broadly so you know the guardrails</strong>, even if you won’t use every detail daily.  </p>
<p>👉 Do you want me to strip that big deck into just the <strong>pieces actually relevant to an RME Tech 2 / Ops support role</strong> so you don’t drown in finance jargon? That way, you’d know exactly why <em>you</em> were looped in.</p>
