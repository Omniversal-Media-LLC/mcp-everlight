<p>Did we determine that staying at this hotel for now is affordable if paid for day to day with my anytime pay option from Amazon?</p>

<p>Let’s break this down and confirm:</p>
<h3 id="to-determine-if-staying-at-the-hotel-day-to-day-is-affordable-using-anytime-pay-we-need-to-answer">✅ To determine if staying at the hotel day-to-day is affordable using <strong>Anytime Pay</strong>, we need to answer:</h3>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-what-is-the-nightly-cost-of-the-hotel">1. <strong>What is the nightly cost of the hotel?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>For example: $80 per night (adjust based on your actual rate).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-how-much-are-you-earning-per-shift">2. <strong>How much are you earning per shift?</strong></h3>
<p>Use this formula:<br />
<strong>Hourly rate × Hours worked per day × Percentage available via Anytime Pay (usually 70%)</strong></p>
<p>If you work <strong>8 hours/day at $18/hr</strong>, and <strong>70% is available</strong> on Anytime Pay:<br />
- Gross daily: $18 × 8 = $144<br />
- Available via Anytime Pay: <strong>$144 × 0.70 = $100.80/day</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-now-compare">3. <strong>Now compare:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hotel cost/day:</strong> $80  </li>
<li><strong>Available from Amazon daily:</strong> ~$100.80  </li>
<li><strong>Remaining after hotel:</strong> <strong>~$20.80/day</strong> (for food, gas, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="so-yes-if-those-numbers-line-up-it-is-affordable-short-term">✅ So yes, <strong>if those numbers line up</strong>, it <em>is</em> affordable short-term.</h3>
<h3 id="things-to-watch-out-for">⚠️ Things to watch out for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taxes/fees from the hotel (ask if they waive deposit for daily guests).</li>
<li>Variability in your hours (if you’re cut short, you might dip below break-even).</li>
<li>When your Anytime Pay resets (some apps limit to once per shift or per 24h).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Would you like me to create a simple daily/weekly budget worksheet based on your exact rate, hotel cost, and hours worked?</p>

<p>920 income per week
Room for two nights was 202 after tax</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-20t195900744221z-assistant">2025-07-20T19:59:00.744221Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect — let’s plug in those numbers to assess day-by-day affordability and create a <strong>clear picture</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="breakdown">🔢 Breakdown:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly Amazon income (via Anytime Pay):</strong> $920  </li>
<li><strong>Hotel cost for 2 nights:</strong> $202<br />
  → So, <strong>$101 per night</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="weekly-hotel-cost-if-staying-all-7-nights">📅 Weekly Hotel Cost (if staying all 7 nights):</h3>
<p>$101 × 7 = <strong>$707 per week</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="remaining-after-hotel">🧾 Remaining after hotel:</h3>
<p>$920 (income) – $707 (hotel) = <strong>$213 per week left</strong><br />
→ That’s <strong>~$30.43/day</strong> for:
- Food
- Gas
- Phone
- Other essentials</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="verdict">✅ Verdict:</h3>
<p><strong>Yes — it’s sustainable short-term</strong>, as long as:
- You <strong>work all your scheduled hours</strong>
- You <strong>avoid unexpected expenses</strong>
- You <strong>keep the rate stable at ~$101/night</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="suggestions">📌 Suggestions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider negotiating</strong> a weekly rate with the front desk if you’re staying consistently. Even a $10/night discount = $70 saved weekly.</li>
<li><strong>Use the $213 buffer</strong> for minor savings, not just daily expenses.</li>
<li>If you plan to split a room in the future (e.g. with Renee or Gina), that would <strong>double your breathing room</strong> financially.</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like me to format this as a printable budget sheet or a day-by-day spending plan?</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-20t195933624590z-user">2025-07-20T19:59:33.624590Z — user</h2>
<p>It is 600 a week if paid for all at once. </p>
<h2 id="2025-07-20t195933709892z-assistant">2025-07-20T19:59:33.709892Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s <strong>great news</strong> — it makes the plan much more sustainable. Let’s recalculate everything based on the <strong>$600 weekly hotel rate</strong> if paid upfront.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="updated-breakdown">🔢 Updated Breakdown:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly Amazon income:</strong> $920  </li>
<li><strong>Weekly hotel cost (paid upfront):</strong> <strong>$600</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Remaining funds:</strong> $920 – $600 = <strong>$320 per week</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="daily-spending-power">📆 Daily Spending Power:</h3>
<p>$320 ÷ 7 days = <strong>~$45.71 per day</strong><br />
→ That’s nearly <strong>$46/day</strong> for:
- Food
- Transportation
- Phone/service
- Emergency items
- Saving a little</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="bottom-line">✅ Bottom Line:</h3>
<p><strong>Yes — it’s very doable and more cost-effective</strong> if you can commit to the full $600 up front at the start of each week.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="recommendation">🟨 Recommendation:</h3>
<p>If you’re unsure you’ll <em>always</em> have the full $600 by the start of the week:
- Use <strong>daily Anytime Pay</strong> for a couple days first
- Then <strong>roll over the leftover into a hotel fund</strong>
- Once you reach $600, <strong>pay for the full week</strong>, gaining $100+ of breathing room</p>
<hr />
<p>Would you like a weekly cash flow tracker or an envelope-style savings plan that helps you time that $600 payment just right?</p>
