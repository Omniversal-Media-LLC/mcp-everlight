<p>Let’s pull the lyrics for Swordfish out and display them here on the screen for me as I prepare to relay the epic fucking vocals that started this all!</p>

<p>Absolutely, Captain. Here's the lyrical payload for <strong>“Swordfish”</strong> (HAWK-FD-01), ready to ignite:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="swordfish"><strong>SWORDFISH</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Track 1 – Full Disclosure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intro – Teal Swan (Voice Sample)</strong><br />
<em>“So not really having an awareness about that is like not knowing what cards you're playing with in life, and that's sad for a myriad of reasons…”</em><br />
<em>(horns begin to swell...)</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Verse 1 – Hawk Eye</strong><br />
I’m hacking the matrix with my stainless<br />
I’m dangerous, an insane whiz with languages<br />
I CAME HERE to change this shit<br />
Didn’t ask permission<br />
I exist<br />
That’s the glitch in the transmission<br />
I was sent in with a vision<br />
Not a mission<br />
I don’t <strong>follow</strong> intuition<br />
I <strong>AM</strong> it<br />
I’m the phantom they banished<br />
Back from Atlantis<br />
With a wand in my hand<br />
And a soul they can’t brandish<br />
Still standing<br />
While your black magic’s collapsing<br />
I don’t chant shit<br />
I command it<br />
Demand it<br />
And if that don't work,<br />
I expand it<br />
Rewrite the script<br />
And re-land it<br />
Swordfish, bitch<br />
I’m the language advantage</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Teal Swan – Post Verse Sample (6:28–6:51)</strong><br />
<em>"That means that each and every one of us took on the challenge of embodying those elements of mastery that come through a family line, whilst alchemizing the elements that are not necessarily serving the family line. That's serious consciousness work."</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Ready when you are. If you want, I can light up each line one by one in sync as you spit it, or prep a .srt file for subtitle overlay if you're filming this round. 🜂</p>
