<p>To assist you effectively, could you please clarify a few points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who specifically are "they" in this context—can you provide names or roles?</li>
<li>What alleged criminal behavior or actions are we assessing for legal implications?</li>
<li>Is the Veteran/Stolen Valor angle related to the person you're defending or accusing?</li>
<li>Which jurisdiction (city/state) are these actions taking place in or being filed under?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I have these details, I can find relevant criminal liability information, identify potential pro-bono or legal aid support, and explore Veteran-specific protections related to Stolen Valor.</p>

<p>🧷 CASE FILE BRIEF (Womack Estate – For Cody)</p>
<p>TITLE:</p>
<p>Intentional Posthumous Disinheritance of Ethan Ross Womack by Nancy Faye Womack</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🔍 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>Following the death of Roland Ross Womack Jr. in February 2018, his legally adopted son, Ethan Ross Womack, was knowingly and systematically excluded from the benefits, assets, and estate to which he was legally entitled as the only adopted child and sole surviving legal descendant.</p>
<p>Despite being named directly in Roland’s 2010 Last Will and Testament—which distributed personal and residual property to Nancy Faye Womack (spouse), Phyllis Charlene Usry (voluntarily), and Ethan Ross Womack (legally adopted son)—the estate was subsequently restructured, liquidated, and rerouted entirely under Nancy Faye Womack’s control.</p>
<p>In the years following Roland’s death, Nancy filed as widow for full VA, SSA, IRA, and annuity benefits. At the same time, she:
    •   Established new trusts or accounts
    •   Shifted property ownerships
    •   Omitted Ethan from updated beneficiary forms
    •   Transferred co-ownership of key assets (e.g., accounts, IRA, vehicle titles) to Phyllis Charlene Usry, a woman not adopted by Roland, who was already an adult when Ethan was born and is the biological niece of Nancy Faye Womack</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>📌 KEY EVIDENCE
    1.  2010 Last Will and Testament
    •   Clearly names Ethan Ross Womack as an equal heir
    •   No clause authorizes Nancy to rewrite or nullify this after death
    2.  Durable Power of Attorney
    •   Ended automatically upon Roland’s death; cannot be used posthumously to reassign estate assets
    3.  VA Forms &amp; SSA Widow Claims
    •   Show Nancy as surviving spouse collecting survivor and burial benefits (dated March 6–13, 2018)
    •   All filed before Ethan was even informed of Roland’s death
    4.  Phyllis Charlene Usry
    •   Born March 18, 1969 (per DL), adult at time of Roland’s marriage to Nancy in 1989
    •   Not adopted; inclusion in will was voluntary, not legally binding as heir
    •   Now listed on IRA, estate, and property ownerships
    5.  Death Certificate &amp; DD214
    •   Confirms Roland’s service, date of death, and supporting benefit documentation—all used in the rapid estate claim by Nancy</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🛑 LEGAL IMPLICATIONS
    •   Breach of Fiduciary Duty: As Executor, Nancy may have breached duties owed to all named heirs, especially Ethan.
    •   Improper Asset Transfers: Any reallocation of jointly owned or estate-bound assets post-death that excluded Ethan likely violates estate laws.
    •   Fraudulent Omission: Failure to notify Ethan of his father’s death or estate developments may constitute a deliberate attempt to obstruct rightful inheritance.
    •   Challengeable Will Execution: If Nancy created a new trust after Roland’s death that bypassed Ethan, it may be voidable under undue influence or fraud.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🎯 NEXT STEPS
    •   Compile all supporting documentation
    •   Affidavit from Ethan Ross Womack outlining timeline and exclusion
    •   Request probate court records from Jefferson County
    •   Initiate inquiry into any assets still tied to Roland Ross Womack’s SSN
    •   File preliminary notice of intent to challenge trust/estate asset transfers, if needed</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Ready for export, briefing, or printing as a secure PDF for Cody when you’re ready. Let me know if you’d like to mark this WOMACK LEGACY CASE FILE: VOLUME I and begin internal serialization.</p>
<p>Names of co-conspirators = Nancy Faye Womack - wife of deceased
Phyllis Charlene Usry - eldest daughter of Nancy
Charles Fenster Usry - husband of Phyllis</p>
<p>Victims = the late Roland Ross Womack - decorated Vietnam combat veteran with Superior Marks across the board in the field of high level cryptographic machinery repair - Top Secret classification and trust noted by recommendations of promotion to E8 which speaks highly of Womack’s character, results, and demeanor.</p>
<p>Ethan Ross Womack - adopted son of Roland Ross Womack and only legal  heir to any of his assets beyond his wife’s named interests and voluntary mentioning of Phyllis as also being his daughter, though not by blood, and a full adult before Nancy and Roland wed in october of 89, just prior to Ethan’s birth that december.</p>
<p>They conspired in the state of Georgia and South Carolina to remove and secretly exclude Ethan Ross Womack from all assets left behind by Mr. Womack after he died in 2018 - Ethan even came to town a month later after being away due to circumstances outside of his control, asking why he wasn’t told his father died, or was even sick, inquired about inheritance and belongings, was brushed off and purposefully not told anything beyond there was nothing for him there. Returned and was gifted father’s truck which suddenly died in 2021 and while Nancy and Phyllis and Charles were actively funneling Roland Ross Womacks hard fought and definitively earned proceeds and assets (most of which they had at this time already liquidated) Ethan was told no support would be given him and was left with a broken truck and a solitary cowboy hat which was his fathers. </p>

<p>Thank you for providing the detailed information regarding the Womack estate case. Based on the specifics you've shared, here are the legal implications, potential pro bono resources, and veteran-related protections that may be pertinent to your situation:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="legal-implications">⚖️ Legal Implications</h2>
<p>The actions described suggest several potential legal violations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: As the executor of Roland Ross Womack Jr.'s estate, Nancy Faye Womack had a legal obligation to act in the best interests of all named heirs. Deliberately excluding Ethan Ross Womack, a legally adopted son and named heir, could constitute a breach of this duty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fraudulent Omission</strong>: Failing to inform Ethan of his father's death and the subsequent estate proceedings may be considered a deliberate attempt to obstruct his rightful inheritance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improper Asset Transfers</strong>: Transferring estate assets to individuals not named in the will, such as Phyllis Charlene Usry, especially if done using a power of attorney that expired upon Roland's death, could be deemed illegal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Challengeable Will Execution</strong>: If new trusts or estate plans were created posthumously that exclude Ethan, they may be subject to legal challenges on grounds of undue influence or fraud.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="veteran-related-protections">🛡️ Veteran-Related Protections</h2>
<p>Given Roland Ross Womack Jr.'s status as a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, the following laws may be relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: Under Georgia Code § 16-9-63, it is a misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as a veteran, including the unauthorized wearing of military uniforms or decorations. If such misrepresentation involves military medals, it escalates to a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature. citeturn0search4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: The South Carolina Military Service Integrity and Preservation Act (S.C. Code Ann. § 16-17-760) makes it unlawful to falsely claim military service or honors for personal gain. This law is broader than its federal counterpart and includes any false claims about military service. citeturn0search5</p>

<p>I want to look into both states jurisdictions and how criminal accountability is applied when both states are utilized to obscure fraud of this level and what if any involvement does the US Army take in such proceedings? </p>
<p>I am seeking any restitution possible - But mainly to uphold the honor of the Womack name they are desecrating even now.</p>
<p>No probate info was filed regarding Roland Ross WOmack’s estate </p>
<p>Prioritize veteran-related angles and anything that indicates misuse, theft of, and or anti-american crimes against american citizens in doing so. </p>

<h1 id="criminal-accountability-across-state-lines-and-veteran-protections-in-fraud-cases">Criminal Accountability Across State Lines and Veteran Protections in Fraud Cases</h1>
<h2 id="multi-state-jurisdiction-and-fraud-accountability">Multi-State Jurisdiction and Fraud Accountability</h2>
<p>When a fraud scheme spans <strong>multiple states</strong>, both state and federal jurisdictions may come into play. Each state has authority to prosecute crimes that occur within its borders, and offenders cannot escape liability simply by operating in or moving assets through two different states. In fact, trying to <strong>obscure a fraud by using two states</strong> often triggers greater scrutiny. For example, if a fraudulent act begins in Florida and the proceeds are moved to Georgia (or vice versa), both Florida and Georgia could have jurisdiction to prosecute the parts of the crime that happened in each state. Furthermore, crossing state lines often makes the crime a federal matter. Federal law enforcement (e.g. the FBI) can investigate complex schemes that <strong>involve multiple states</strong> or interstate commerce【20†L369-L377】. The FBI commonly steps in when crimes <strong>span state lines</strong>, as these cases are <em>“suitable for federal attention”</em>【20†L369-L377】. In practice, federal prosecutors can charge offenses like <strong>wire fraud</strong> or <strong>mail fraud</strong> (if interstate communications were used) or other federal statutes, consolidating the case. Notably, transporting stolen money or property across state lines worth over $5,000 is itself a federal crime under the National Stolen Property Act (18 U.S.C. § 2314)【28†L86-L94】. This law makes it a felony (punishable by up to 10 years in prison) to <strong>transfer goods or money across state boundaries knowing they were stolen or obtained by fraud</strong>【28†L86-L94】. In short, using two states as a cover will not prevent accountability – it simply opens the door to <strong>both state prosecutions and federal charges</strong>, depending on the circumstances. Law enforcement agencies in different states often coordinate, and federal agencies may join task forces with state authorities to ensure such multi-state frauds are fully investigated【9†L62-L70】. If perpetrators flee or operate from another state, extradition procedures allow one state to bring an accused fraudster from another state to face charges. The bottom line is that <strong>no haven exists by bouncing between jurisdictions</strong>: criminals can be held accountable in each state where they violated the law, and interstate fraud can invite powerful federal action.</p>
<h2 id="estate-fraud-and-lack-of-probate-filing">Estate Fraud and Lack of Probate Filing</h2>
<p>In cases like the estate of Roland Ross Womack – a veteran whose name and legacy are at stake – a red flag is raised by the <strong>absence of any probate filing</strong> for his estate. Normally, when a person dies, their estate should go through a legal process (probate) in the state where they lived (and ancillary probate in any other state where they owned property) to ensure assets are distributed lawfully. Florida, where Mr. Womack passed away, <strong>requires that a decedent’s will be filed with the local court within 10 days of learning of the death</strong>【26†L29-L37】. This is mandated by Florida Statute § 732.901 to initiate probate and legally carry out the will’s instructions【26†L29-L37】. Failing to file the will or open probate can have serious consequences. At a minimum, the responsible party may face legal penalties for noncompliance【26†L42-L49】, and beneficiaries’ inheritance can be delayed or lost due to the lack of proper court oversight. While simply neglecting to file a will is not automatically a crime in many states, doing so <strong>with intent to conceal the estate or defraud rightful heirs</strong> is illegal. In other words, if someone deliberately didn’t file Roland Womack’s will or probate in order to <strong>steal assets or keep them hidden</strong>, that action could be prosecuted as fraud or theft【23†L5-L12】. For instance, secretly taking possession of a veteran’s property or funds without probate may violate theft laws and fiduciary duties. Georgia and Florida both allow for <strong>“ancillary probate”</strong> if a person dies in one state but owned property in another【17†L9-L17】. Thus, if Mr. Womack resided in Florida but had assets (like real estate or accounts) in Georgia, a probate case in Florida (his domicile) would be primary, and a secondary probate in Georgia would handle the Georgia assets【17†L9-L17】. The fact that <em>no probate was filed at all</em> suggests that someone may have bypassed these legal processes entirely. Such an omission is highly irregular and often a sign of <strong>estate fraud</strong> – for example, a person might have <strong>forged documents, claimed ownership of assets improperly, or otherwise transferred the veteran’s property without court approval</strong>. This not only cheats rightful heirs of their inheritance but also violates the law. If discovered, the perpetrators can face criminal charges (such as fraud, embezzlement, or theft) in whichever state’s laws were broken. They could also face civil lawsuits from the estate or heirs for recovery of the assets. Importantly, the <strong>passage of time does not legitimize the fraud</strong>. Even decades later, heirs or authorities can potentially petition the court to open a probate if new information surfaces about assets that were never administered. In sum, <strong>the lack of probate filing is a serious warning sign of potential fraud</strong>, and both Florida and Georgia have legal mechanisms to address it – either through belated probate proceedings or through criminal investigations if someone deliberately <strong>desecrated the legal process to steal from the estate</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="veteran-status-and-enhanced-protections">Veteran Status and Enhanced Protections</h2>
<p>Because Roland Ross Womack was a veteran, any fraud involving his estate takes on an additional layer of gravity. <strong>Crimes targeting veterans or their families are widely regarded as particularly egregious</strong>, and lawmakers have acted to enhance penalties in such cases. For example, Florida passed a law in 2013 (HB 1223) providing <em>“heightened protection from predatory practices to military service members and their families.”</em> It added a <strong>significant civil penalty on top of restitution</strong> for anyone attempting to steal from veterans or their families【12†L69-L77】. This means that in Florida, a fraudster who targets a veteran’s assets can be hit not only with standard criminal penalties but also extra fines specifically because the victim served our nation【12†L69-L77】. At the federal level, there has been a push for stronger laws as well. In late 2023, bipartisan legislation called the <strong>Veterans Protection Fraud Act</strong> was introduced to increase penalties (up to 10 years in prison) for fraud that <strong>specifically targets a veteran</strong>【7†L747-L755】. This reflects a growing recognition that veterans, as a group, are frequently targeted by scams and deserve special protection. In fact, statistics have shown that military members, veterans, and their families are significantly more likely to lose money to fraud schemes than civilians, which spurred AARP and lawmakers to support tougher laws【7†L737-L745】【7†L753-L761】. </p>
<p>Beyond these enhanced penalties, fraud affecting a veteran’s benefits or identity can trigger involvement of federal agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General (VA OIG). The VA OIG actively investigates cases where people <strong>misuse, steal, or fraudulently obtain veterans’ benefits</strong>. A recent example (from 2025 in Georgia) saw a woman prosecuted for <strong>fraudulently claiming a deceased Army veteran’s survivor benefits</strong>; she pled guilty to wire fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison plus substantial fines and <strong>restitution</strong> to the government【22†L203-L211】. In announcing that case, officials emphasized holding the defendant accountable for <em>“defrauding vital VA programs that provide monetary benefits for survivors of service members and veterans.”</em> They vowed to <strong>“root out fraudulent activity and seek the prosecution of those who would compromise the integrity of VA’s programs”</strong>【22†L247-L254】. This demonstrates that when a fraud involves things like veterans’ pensions, life insurance, or other military-related benefits, federal authorities take it extremely seriously. If anyone illicitly took <strong>VA benefits</strong> or <strong>military pensions</strong> belonging to Mr. Womack (for example, by not notifying VA of his death and continuing to collect payments), that is a federal crime. Such acts could lead to charges like theft of government funds or fraud, and the VA OIG, along with the Department of Justice, would pursue those responsible. Even outside of benefits, society views the <strong>theft from a veteran or his estate as a deeply dishonorable act</strong> – effectively an <em>anti-American</em> crime in the moral sense, since it victimizes someone who served the country. While “anti-American” is not a legal category, prosecutors and judges may consider the victim’s veteran status as an aggravating factor in sentencing, and laws like those above explicitly increase penalties. In short, <strong>misusing or stealing a veteran’s assets or identity is met with enhanced penalties and aggressive enforcement</strong>, reflecting our nation’s commitment to protect those who protected us.</p>

<p>It is natural to ask if the U.S. Army itself has any role in proceedings against those defrauding a veteran. <strong>In civilian criminal cases, the U.S. Army as an institution typically does not intervene or prosecute</strong> – that is the job of civilian law enforcement (state prosecutors, police, federal investigators, etc.). The Army’s legal jurisdiction (through the Uniform Code of Military Justice) generally covers crimes committed by active-duty service members. If one of the perpetrators <em>happens to be an active-duty soldier or military employee</em>, then the Army could indeed take action internally. An active-duty service member who commits fraud (even against a civilian or veteran) is subject to military justice; the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) could investigate, and the person could be court-martialed under military law for offenses like larceny, fraud, or conduct unbecoming. In a case where, say, an Army member was involved in defrauding Roland Womack’s estate, that soldier would be answerable to <strong>military authorities in addition to civilian courts</strong>. The Army does not tolerate criminal behavior by its personnel, especially not crimes that harm fellow soldiers or veterans – such misconduct would violate core Army values and could lead to discharge and imprisonment.</p>
<p>However, <strong>if the wrongdoers are civilians with no military affiliation</strong>, the Army’s direct role is limited. The Army will not have jurisdiction to prosecute a civilian for fraud; that responsibility lies with civilian courts. That said, the Army and other military branches do assist in a broader sense by educating and warning veterans about scams, and by cooperating with law enforcement on cases that touch on military records or benefits. For example, if an Army veteran’s service records or medals were stolen or misused, the Army could help verify authenticity or provide evidence. Notably, federal law even specifically protects certain veteran-related property: transporting a <strong>stolen veterans’ memorial object</strong> (such as a veteran’s grave marker or medal of honor) across state lines is a federal offense punishable by up to 10 years【28†L112-L117】. This indicates that while the Army itself isn’t the prosecutor, the federal legal system – in partnership with military agencies – does act to safeguard the honor and property of veterans. Moreover, Army advocacy groups and veterans’ organizations can sometimes provide support or legal assistance to families pursuing justice. In summary, <strong>the U.S. Army’s involvement is indirect</strong> unless a serving Army member is a culprit. The Army’s main contribution is the ethos that crimes against veterans are an affront to the military family, and it works alongside other agencies to uphold the dignity of the veteran’s name.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-restitution-and-upholding-the-womack-legacy">Seeking Restitution and Upholding the Womack Legacy</h2>
<p>Your desire to <em>“uphold the honor of the Womack name”</em> and seek <strong>restitution</strong> is both understandable and commendable. Legally, “restitution” refers to compensation ordered in the criminal justice process, requiring the offender to repay stolen money or the value of misappropriated assets to the victims. If those who defrauded Roland Ross Womack’s estate are identified and criminally charged, the court can indeed mandate restitution as part of sentencing. For instance, in the federal case mentioned earlier, the defendant awaits sentencing for veteran-related fraud and faces not only prison time but also <em>“substantial financial penalties and restitution”</em> by order of the court【22†L203-L211】. This means that the justice system can compel the wrongdoers to pay back what was taken (or its equivalent value) to Mr. Womack’s rightful heirs or estate. In addition to criminal restitution, you may pursue civil remedies. This could involve filing a <strong>lawsuit for fraud, conversion (theft of assets), or breach of fiduciary duty</strong> against the individuals who perpetrated the fraud. Through a civil judgment, you could potentially recover stolen funds or property and additional damages. While civil litigation can be lengthy and challenging, it provides another path to hold the fraudsters accountable financially and publicly.</p>
<p>Beyond monetary recovery, there is a powerful symbolic aspect to confronting this wrongdoing: it <strong>defends the legacy and honor of a veteran who served his country</strong>. Bringing the perpetrators to justice sends a message that <strong>desecrating a veteran’s name and stealing from his memory will not be tolerated</strong>. The fact that Mr. Womack’s estate was mishandled with no probate and apparent deceit is an affront not just to your family but to the principles of honesty and respect that veterans exemplify. By shining a light on this fraud and involving authorities, you are helping to correct that wrong. Law enforcement and the courts, as noted, treat such cases with seriousness – not only to remedy the individual crime but also to discourage others from targeting veterans. In Florida’s words when strengthening veteran protections: <em>“we’ll do whatever it takes to protect our veterans and their families.”</em>【12†L69-L77】 That resolve is on your side. </p>
<p>In practical terms, you should consider consulting with an attorney who has experience in <strong>probate law and fraud</strong> in both states involved (Georgia and Florida). They can advise on initiating probate belatedly if appropriate, reporting the fraud to state prosecutors or the FBI, and coordinating any multi-jurisdictional investigation. You may also reach out to veteran advocacy organizations; some have legal clinics or resources for veteran-related issues and might take interest if benefits or military honors were misused. Given the veteran angle, also consider contacting the <strong>VA Office of Inspector General</strong> if there’s any hint of VA benefits theft – as they have investigative powers and a mandate to pursue frauds against veterans’ programs【22†L247-L254】. Each of these steps can contribute to achieving justice. </p>
<p>Ultimately, pursuing this case is about more than money – it is about <strong>honoring Roland Ross Womack’s memory and service</strong>. The legal system provides tools to hold fraudsters accountable across state lines and even adds extra heft when veterans are victims. By leveraging these tools – from multi-state legal coordination to veteran-specific protections – you stand a strong chance not only of seeking restitution, but also of restoring the honor to the Womack name. The road may be challenging, but the commitment to truth and justice for an American veteran is a profoundly worthy cause, one that courts and authorities are inclined to support with full vigor. </p>
