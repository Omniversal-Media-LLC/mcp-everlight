<p>{"content_type": "audio_transcription", "text": "The party that I have attempted to bring this idea to has defaulted to saying I can't do it now, it's a waste of my time. And that only speaks to their fear of what could be, so I'm going to ask you. I have for me a food menu of an idea at this local brewery that I've networked with to use the local food places since they don't have a restaurant space because they're a brewery in the back to build a sort of Uber Lyft type delivery app that people could scan a QR code in the brewery for food that they want to order And then that food is then ordered via Uber or Lyft or whatever, Uber Eats, whatever you want to call it, from that restaurant, delivered here in the back end, and then delivered, plated, and all this and that to this brewery and their customers. And they don't ever need to know the back end of how it all happens, but they still get food and this attracts more people. Tell me your thoughts on this and then I'll send the preliminary menu this person has on Tuesday, I'm going to be meeting with the owner here, his name is Dee, and getting some more insights into the culture. The parking lot started five months ago and the place is completely dead, but it is in a very live spot. The parking lot has no open parking lots.", "direction": "in", "decoding_id": null}

<p>{"content_type": "audio_transcription", "text": "I think that idea sounds really innovative! It's a smart way to bridge the gap for the brewery since they don't have a kitchen on-site, and it could definitely draw in more customers who want to enjoy some good food along with their drinks. Plus, using a QR code system keeps it simple and modern. It sounds like you've got a great meeting lined up, and I'm sure Dean will be excited to hear your ideas!", "direction": "out", "decoding_id": null}
