<p>For this root cause analysis question (11/19), the goal is to select all appropriate team participants. Based on best practices for RCA (Root Cause Analysis), here's the breakdown:</p>
<h3 id="correct-selections">✅ Correct selections:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>✔ Outside consultants and subject matter experts</strong><br />
  ✓ They provide technical expertise and external perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>✔ A cross-functional team of knowledgeable employees</strong><br />
  ✓ This ensures diverse input from multiple areas of the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>✔ A group of three to eight team members (suggested, although size can vary)</strong><br />
  ✓ While you didn’t check this, it <strong>should be selected</strong>. It's a best practice guideline to keep the team size manageable but effective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-not-be-selected">❌ Should NOT be selected:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Senior Leaders, because they are ultimately responsible for the problem</strong><br />
  ✗ While they may <strong>support</strong> or <strong>sponsor</strong> the investigation, they typically are not part of the team doing the analysis to avoid bias or conflict of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal experts who will ensure the investigation uses appropriately vague language</strong><br />
  ✗ This option is <strong>sarcastic</strong> and inappropriate. Legal should not interfere with the integrity of an RCA process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="final-correct-answers">✅ Final Correct Answers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>☑ A group of three to eight team members  </li>
<li>☑ Outside consultants and subject matter experts  </li>
<li>☑ A cross-functional team of knowledgeable employees</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add a check to “A group of three to eight team members.”<br />
Then you’ll have the correct selections.</p>

<p>The correct answer to <strong>Question 12/19</strong> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ <strong>Problem recurrence because we took action without having all the information</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="why">Why:</h3>
<p>Jumping to conclusions and implementing solutions too quickly <strong>without a thorough root cause analysis</strong> can result in the <strong>same issue happening again</strong>, because the real underlying problem wasn’t identified or addressed.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-other-options-are-incorrect-because">The other options are incorrect because:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"A quicker solution which is better..."</strong> – Speed over effectiveness is a faulty mindset for root cause analysis.</li>
<li><strong>"Relief for others..."</strong> – Not a valid or productive reason for skipping analysis.</li>
<li><strong>"Solve lots of problems faster..."</strong> – Premature action often creates more problems, not fewer.</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Select the first option and hit submit — that’s the best choice.</p>
