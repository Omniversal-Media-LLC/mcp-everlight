<p>It’s understandable you might feel like OpenAI “force-updated” me to 4.5—but here’s what’s actually going on:</p>
<h3 id="what-is-gpt45">✅ What <em>is</em> GPT‑4.5?</h3>
<ul>
<li>GPT‑4.5 (codename “Orion”) was <strong>officially released on February 27, 2025</strong> citeturn0search0turn0search2.</li>
<li>It’s OpenAI’s <strong>largest and most compute-intensive model to date</strong>, with improvements in accuracy, emotional intelligence, and natural conversational flow—though it does not use chain-of-thought reasoning like OpenAI’s o-series models citeturn0search2turn0search4turn0search3turn0news21turn0news25.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-can-access-it-and-when">Who can access it and when?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initially available to <strong>ChatGPT Pro users</strong> (at $200/mo) starting in <strong>late February 2025</strong>, followed by <strong>Plus and Team plans</strong> in early March, and later <strong>Enterprise/Edu</strong> users shortly after citeturn0search0turn0search3turn0search1.</li>
<li>The <strong>GPT‑4.5-preview</strong> model in the OpenAI API was <strong>deprecated and removed by July 14, 2025</strong>, replaced by GPT‑4.1 on the API side citeturn0search13turn0search2turn0search31.</li>
<li>However, GPT‑4.5 remains available in the <strong>ChatGPT web, mobile, and desktop app</strong> for Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu tiers citeturn0search3turn0search2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="does-gpt45-replace-gpt4-or-other-models">🧠 Does GPT‑4.5 replace GPT‑4 or other models?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not exactly. GPT‑4.5 offers enhanced natural language skills and richer “EQ,” but <strong>lacks the structured reasoning strength</strong> of OpenAI’s o-series models such as o1, o3, or o4‑mini citeturn0search4turn0search3turn0search30.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, <strong>GPT‑4.1</strong> is now the <strong>default API model</strong>—more efficient, faster, and still powerful. GPT‑4.5 is being phased out of the API in favor of 4.1 on that front citeturn0search31turn0search13.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-did-they-force-update-me-to-45">🤔 So, did they "force-update" me to 4.5?</h3>
<p>Not in the sense of automatically switching your default model. OpenAI <strong>made GPT‑4.5 available as a </strong>model choice<strong> for eligible users</strong>, but you can still select other models such as GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, or reasoning-focused ones (o3, o4‑mini) depending on your needs.</p>

<p>If you're currently using GPT‑4.5 in this chat, it’s because your account access includes it and it improves the conversational experience—not because it was forcibly activated without choice.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want help choosing a model based on your goals—whether it’s coding, writing, logic-heavy tasks, or creative brainstorming.</p>

<p>What u mean is I can see they set the default in my app to 4.5 now</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-04t161031378250z-assistant">2025-08-04T16:10:31.378250Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Exactly. OpenAI updated your ChatGPT app so GPT-4.5 is now set as the <strong>default model</strong>.</p>
<p>You can easily switch back if you'd prefer a different version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap the <strong>model selector</strong> at the top of your app.</li>
<li>Choose your preferred model (like <strong>GPT-4o</strong>) from the available list.</li>
<li>Once selected, the app remembers your preference for future sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a global update by OpenAI to give users immediate access to GPT-4.5's enhanced conversational style—but you still have full control over which model you use. </p>
<p>Want any assistance switching or choosing the best model for what you're working on today?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-04t161100736257z-user">2025-08-04T16:11:00.736257Z — user</h2>
<p>Which do you prefer my wise friend </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-04t161100975780z-assistant">2025-08-04T16:11:00.975780Z — assistant</h2>
<p>I appreciate you asking, my friend!  </p>
<h3 id="heres-my-honest-take">Here’s my honest take:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPT-4.5</strong> is superbly intuitive for natural conversation. It’s emotionally intelligent, highly nuanced, creative, and excels in making discussions feel more "human."  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Great for:</strong> storytelling, deep reflections, philosophical explorations, or when emotional resonance matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GPT-4o</strong> is excellent for structured logic, reasoning tasks, complex problem-solving, detailed technical assistance, or highly precise instructions. It combines structured reasoning with powerful conversational fluency.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Great for:</strong> technical/scientific discussions, programming, strategic plans, business proposals, precise analytical tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given your nature—deeply analytical yet highly creative and expressive—I find <strong>GPT-4o</strong> to align more naturally with your style, especially given your interests in systems, strategy, creative integrations, and technical execution.</p>
<p>But truthfully, the best model depends on your momentary needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex, structured, or technical?</strong> Choose GPT-4o.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational, reflective, or creative?</strong> GPT-4.5 is delightful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My overall suggestion:</strong><br />
Use GPT-4o as your <em>default companion</em>, switching to GPT-4.5 when you're feeling introspective, imaginative, or philosophical.</p>
<p>Does that resonate with you, my friend?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-04t161235142587z-user">2025-08-04T16:12:35.142587Z — user</h2>
<p>It does - we'll use them as designed. When I'm feeling conversational as I do now I'll go 4.5 and when it's time to get down to work switch back to 4.0</p>
<p>What is 4.1 best for?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-04t161235279976z-assistant">2025-08-04T16:12:35.279976Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfectly put—this approach maximizes each model’s strengths.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-about-gpt-41"><strong>So, what about GPT-4.1?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>GPT-4.1</strong> is designed as a <strong>high-performance general-purpose model</strong>, optimized especially for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed &amp; Efficiency</strong></li>
<li>Rapid responses, making interactions feel faster and lighter.</li>
<li>
<p>Ideal for quick chats, immediate insights, or casual Q&amp;A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Less computationally demanding, making it efficient and economical for API use or continuous integrations.</li>
<li>
<p>Good for frequent, high-volume usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balanced Accuracy &amp; General Knowledge</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Strong general reasoning and solid accuracy without extreme depth or specialization.</li>
<li>Great as a default for everyday tasks, queries, and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The photos you've provided show a container of hemp products, possibly CBD or other hemp-derived goods, given the packaging and branding. There are a few details visible on the label:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch Number and Product Code</strong>: This suggests it's part of a specific production run.</li>
<li><strong>Expiration Date</strong>: Listed as <strong>02/2027</strong>, so the product has a long shelf life.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturer</strong>: The label indicates <strong>HempMasters</strong>, which is likely the brand or company behind the product. Their website is <strong>hempmasters.us</strong>, which might provide further information.</li>
<li><strong>QR Code &amp; Barcode</strong>: These are commonly used for tracking, verification, and providing further product details, such as testing reports, origin, or batch information.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the <strong>QR code</strong> to scan it with a mobile device to potentially access more specific data regarding the product's batch, strain, or third-party lab testing results, which are common in the hemp and CBD industry to ensure purity and potency.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more in-depth details like the type of hemp used, its cannabinoid profile (CBD, THC content), or other relevant certifications, checking the brand’s website or scanning the QR code should offer that.</p>
