<p>Excellent follow-up — let’s laser in on what <em>actually applies</em> to <strong>your specific case</strong> regarding Roland R. Womack’s estate and whether statute of limitations (SOL) matters <strong>pose a threat or not</strong>.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Issue</strong></th>
<th><strong>Relevant Limitation</strong></th>
<th><strong>Does It Apply Here?</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Contesting a Will</strong></td>
<td>30 days (solemn form) or 4 years (common form)</td>
<td>⚠️ Likely expired unless there was <strong>fraud or concealment</strong>, which can <strong>toll</strong> the SOL (i.e. pause the countdown).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Claims of Fraud or Theft</strong></td>
<td>4 years from <strong>discovery</strong> of the fraud (<strong>not</strong> from date of death)</td>
<td>✅ THIS IS CRITICAL: If you <em>just discovered</em> the concealment or misappropriation of property (e.g. trust docs, firearm list, estate distribution), the clock may have <strong>just started.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Breach of Fiduciary Duty / Conversion</strong></td>
<td>Also typically 4 years from discovery</td>
<td>✅ If Faye misused her power or rerouted assets, <strong>you may still have time</strong> — again, tied to <strong>when you first became aware</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Probate filing</strong></td>
<td>Wills must be probated within 5 years</td>
<td>❓Only applies if <strong>no will was ever filed</strong> — if Faye used an alternative legal method (like claiming no will existed), this might be actionable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Trust Challenge</strong></td>
<td>2 years from settlor’s death — <strong>only for revocable trusts</strong></td>
<td>❗If Faye created a trust <strong>after</strong> his death, this <strong>doesn’t protect her</strong> — it may be a <em>fraudulent trust</em>, not a standard revocable one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wrongful transfer of firearms/safe assets</strong></td>
<td>4 years from discovery of loss/conversion</td>
<td>✅ You can assert rightful ownership — especially if there is <strong>proof your father intended them for you</strong>.</td>
</tr>

<h3 id="so-is-the-statute-of-limitations-a-problem">✅ So, Is the Statute of Limitations a Problem?</h3>
<p><strong>Only if you waited too long after discovering what happened.</strong><br />
But you <em>just started uncovering proof</em> (e.g. gun list, fake trust, signatures), so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔔 <strong>NO — It’s not too late</strong>. If fraud, concealment, or fiduciary misconduct is involved — the statute is <strong>tolled (paused)</strong> until discovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means Veronika is right to <em>mention it</em>, but you can tell her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, I’m aware — but since we’re just now uncovering the fraud, the limitations period hasn’t even started yet. Discovery rule applies. So we’re good."</p>
</blockquote>
