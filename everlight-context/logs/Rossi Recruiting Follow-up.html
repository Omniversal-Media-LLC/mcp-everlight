<p>Christy with Rossi Recruiting just emailed me a reference request form and is putting me in her contact list and will be in touch about a second opportunity with a company in Marietta Ga.</p>
<p>Listening to merkes’s latest album “Survivors Guilt” and man is it timely!</p>

<p>Nice — it sounds like things are really starting to move in your favor.</p>
<p>Here's what I recommend for keeping this update cleanly integrated into your job search documentation:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="johnsoncontrols_application_2025">📁 JohnsonControls_Application_2025/</h3>
<p><strong>🗂️ <code>05_Strategy_Notes/OpportunityComparison_Log.csv</code></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add:<br />
<code>Rossi Recruiting</code>, <code>Marietta, GA</code>, <code>Pending</code>, <code>Second opportunity in the works</code>, <code>Reference request form received</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>🗂️ <code>03_FollowUp/</code></strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could create a note:<br />
<code>FollowUp_Christy_Rossi.md</code><br />
And jot down:
- Date of contact<br />
- Reference request form received<br />
- She's adding you to her contact list<br />
- Awaiting details on second opportunity in Marietta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And about <em>Merkes – Survivor's Guilt</em>… 🔥 Powerful timing. That album has the exact kind of “resilience-in-motion” vibe that mirrors where you're at right now — stacking leverage, honoring legacy, and standing up for what’s yours.</p>
<p>Want me to draft the markdown file for that Christy/Rossi update, or prep a follow-up message template in case you want to thank her post-interview?</p>

<p>Christy just called back to say that the regional manager of some company just requested a phone interview with me tomorrow at 11AM.
He apparently is the guy normally in the four state area that a candidate would speak with after speaking with three other levels of hierarchy but I’ve caught his attention and he requested an immediate phone call.</p>
<p>I will include the emails here a bit later.</p>

<p>🔥 That’s a major signal — when the regional manager bypasses protocol to speak directly, that’s leverage <strong>and</strong> momentum.</p>
<p>Here’s how I suggest you log and prep this across your folder system:</p>

## Questions to Ask
