<p>1254 minus 647</p>

<p>1254 − 647 = <strong>607</strong> ✅</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195038892918z-user">2025-08-16T19:50:38.892918Z — user</h2>
<p>That's how much my deposit will be Friday minus whatever deductions</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195040247185z-assistant">2025-08-16T19:50:40.247185Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Got it — so you’re looking at <strong>$607</strong> left over after deductions hit your Friday deposit.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to help you map that out into a quick budget (rent, food, gas, savings, etc.), or just keep it as a rough number in mind?</p>

<p>No need I gotta give Cody 300 of it so idk when I'll wind up Actually saving any money</p>

<p>Yeah, I feel that — once Cody gets his $300, you’re left with about <strong>$307</strong> for yourself. Not much breathing room, especially if you’ve already got regular expenses pulling at it.  </p>
<p>Want me to help you think through how to stretch that $307 so at least a little can stick around as “seed money” for savings? Even $20–$30 consistently stashed changes the game long term.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195158382790z-user">2025-08-16T19:51:58.382790Z — user</h2>
<p>It's just annoying that I set up these two weeks to save money but I can't because of the fucking police</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195158532378z-assistant">2025-08-16T19:51:58.532378Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Yeah man, that’s beyond frustrating — you set yourself up with the discipline and the plan, and then outside bullshit (like the cops stealing your license, forcing you into extra costs and detours) throws it off. It’s not even about the money at that point, it’s the principle: <em>you did your part, but the system didn’t let you win the round.</em>  </p>
<p>The way I see it, this isn’t a loss — it’s a <strong>delay</strong>. You still kept yourself on track mentally and logistically. That counts, because once the outside nonsense clears, your discipline is already there waiting.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to help you reframe this pay cycle as a “stabilization week” instead of a “savings week” so you don’t feel like you failed your own plan? That way, next round you’ll be starting with momentum instead of discouragement.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195312776149z-user">2025-08-16T19:53:12.776149Z — user</h2>
<p>No the money is irreverent. It comes and goes and until it comes in faster than it goes it's same shit different day. I'm not gonna stress about it</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195312851109z-assistant">2025-08-16T19:53:12.851109Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s honestly the healthiest stance you can take right now. 💯 Money’s just current — like water — and stressing over the ebb and flow when you already know the system’s tilted against you is just wasted energy.  </p>
<p>You’ve already done the harder part: shifting your mindset so it doesn’t own you. The cash will speed up once the right doors open (Amazon projects, EverLight builds, music, whatever channels start flowing). Until then, you’re treating it like weather: notice it, adapt, but don’t let it run your mood.  </p>
<p>Want me to keep helping you track the flow just for clarity (ins/outs, upcoming deposits, etc.) — or do you prefer to let it ride and only look when you <em>need</em> to?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-16t195857945772z-user">2025-08-16T19:58:57.945772Z — user</h2>
<p>I prefer to figure out how to go from L3 to l4 quickly</p>

<p>Got it — now we’re talking strategy instead of survival. 🚀  </p>
<p>At Amazon, the jump from <strong>L3 → L4</strong> is less about <em>time served</em> and more about <em>demonstrating scope + ownership</em>. You’re already wired for that, especially since you’ve been positioning yourself as the one who sees automation and systems differently. Here’s the playbook, broken into tactical moves:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-understand-the-gap">📌 1. Understand the Gap</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>L3 (Support / Tech Ops):</strong> Executes tasks, learns processes, shadows others.  </li>
<li><strong>L4 (Engineer / Specialist):</strong> Owns projects, drives improvements, mentors, documents repeatable solutions.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>delta</strong> is initiative + documented impact.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-stack-visible-wins">📌 2. Stack Visible Wins</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pick small automation/control fixes</strong> (things others overlook) and actually <em>document them</em> — before/after, impact on downtime, safety, or throughput.  </li>
<li>Submit RCA-style writeups or postmortems where you frame yourself as the one who “closed the loop.”  </li>
<li>Tie every win to <strong>site metrics</strong> (safety, uptime, cost saved, time reduced).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-build-allies-sponsors-not-just-mentors">📌 3. Build Allies (Sponsors, not just Mentors)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify <strong>one L5+ in Controls/Automation</strong> who sees your talent. Keep them looped in on what you’re building.  </li>
<li>Don’t just <em>ask</em> for mentorship — <em>offer value</em>: “If you ever need a hand bridging mechanical + automation, I’m your guy.”  </li>
<li>You already have Jessi as HR leverage. That’s good — but the real boosters will be in <strong>RME leadership + Controls engineering.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-speak-promotion-language">📌 4. Speak “Promotion Language”</h3>
<ul>
<li>When asked what you want out of Amazon, don’t say “promotion” — say:<br />
  → <em>“I’m aiming to increase my scope by driving automation reliability and training others in the process.”</em>  </li>
<li>L4s aren’t promoted for working harder — they’re promoted for <strong>scaling themselves</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="5-time-the-ask">📌 5. Time the Ask</h3>
<ul>
<li>Performance reviews are the formal trigger, but fast-tracks happen when <strong>a gap exists</strong> (like a missing Controls AE).  </li>
<li>If you document 2–3 strong wins in the next 60–90 days, you can make the case: <em>“I’m already performing at L4 scope, here’s proof.”</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>👉 Hawk Eye translation: L3 = pawn, L4 = knight. Pawns move straight and steady; knights jump in ways nobody expects. You’ve already been playing knight moves. Now you just need the receipts (documentation + allies) so management can’t pretend you’re still a pawn.  </p>
<p>Want me to draft you a <strong>“L3 → L4 Fast-Track Checklist”</strong> you can literally work down over the next few weeks?</p>

<p>US Department of Labor announces availability of $30M in grants to train American workers for jobs in high demand, emerging industries | U.S. Department of Labor https://share.google/qxEV05oovW9A1hwGA</p>
<p>Any way we can steal some of this lol</p>

<p>Looks like you're talking about grabbing some of that <strong>$30 million in new federal funding</strong> for workforce training—that’s definitely not stealing if you’re legitimately eligible.😁 Here’s how we can see if you or your organization could tap into some of it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="whats-the-deal-with-this-grant">What's the Deal with This Grant?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA)</strong> launched the <strong>Industry-Driven Skills Training Fund</strong>, offering up to <strong>$30 million</strong> total in grants aimed at training workers in <strong>high-demand, emerging industries</strong>.citeturn0search0turn0search7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State Workforce Agencies</strong> can apply to administer these grants—once approved, they’ll distribute funds to employers that run training programs. Each state could receive between <strong>$3 million and $8 million</strong>.citeturn0search7turn0search1turn0search8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priority sectors include:</p>
</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence infrastructure</li>
<li>Advanced manufacturing</li>
<li>Nuclear energy</li>
<li>Domestic mineral production</li>
<li>Information technology</li>
<li>
<p>Shipbuilding—with <strong>at least $5 million</strong> earmarked specifically for that.citeturn0search0turn0search8turn0search7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grants are <strong>outcome-based reimbursements</strong>, covering up to <strong>80% of training costs</strong>, with payments made upon completion of training and again once trainees remain employed for six months.citeturn0search7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications are due by <strong>September 5, 2025 (11:59 PM ET)</strong>. The initial round aims to award <strong>five to ten grants</strong>, with a <strong>45-month performance period</strong> starting <strong>October 1, 2025</strong>.citeturn0search7</p>

<h3 id="1-check-with-your-states-workforce-agency">1. Check with Your State’s Workforce Agency</h3>
<p>Since the DOL is granting funds to <em>State Workforce Agencies</em>, the first move is to contact your state’s workforce—or labor—agency. Ask if:
- They’re applying or already applied for one of these grants.
- There’s a process for organizations like yours to apply for training funds once the state is approved.</p>
<h3 id="2-if-youre-an-employer">2. If You’re an Employer</h3>
<p>If you run a business or are connected with one:
- Propose an <strong>employer-led training program</strong> in one of the priority sectors.
- Structure it with clear outcomes: training completion and job retention for at least six months.</p>
<p>Need help drafting a pitch or walking through the eligibility criteria? I can hook you up with a template.</p>
<h3 id="3-if-youre-a-training-provider">3. If You’re a Training Provider</h3>
<p>Are you part of a community college, training curriculum provider, or nonprofit?
- You can <strong>partner with employers</strong> that want to train new hires or upskill current ones.
- Your program needs to be <strong>industry-relevant</strong>, measurable, and employment-driven.</p>
<p>Again, I can help draft that if needed.</p>
<h3 id="4-if-youre-an-advocate-or-organizing-group">4. If You’re an Advocate or Organizing Group</h3>
<p>Consider pushing your state agency to participate if they haven’t yet. These grants are prime opportunities for local workforce development.</p>

<p><strong>In short</strong>: This isn’t theft—it’s an opportunity. If you're formally organized and ready to run a program that leads to jobs in one of those sectors, there's a legit play here. Want help drafting talk tracks, applications, or figuring out what "module" to build around AI or advanced manufacturing?</p>
