Payee Central Scope referral  https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Payee_Central/Payee_Central_Current_Scope_Matrix/   Foreign Vendors: of a vendor has already onboarded at any other Amazon country, they will have to onboard again to submit to the specific country tax interview If your Vendor will supply both SERVICES and GOODS, two separated onboard invitations are required.

<p>Confirmation, Approval and Payment (1 of 3) 
https://inside.amazon.com/en/services/finance/accountspayable/Pages/SA-AP.aspx <br />
GOODS :  3-Way match  The PO Owner is responsible  for confirming that the item was received and there is match between the ordered and received material.  COUPA:  https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/72541 SC.OS/ Cloudforge   https://w.amazon.com/bin/viewrev/AWS_SCM_OPS_SUPPORT_FAQ/WebHome?rev=71.1#HReceivingorReturningonCFPlatform SERVICES : Confirmation of Service and Approval for Payment    Once the invoice is processed, the PO Owner receives an e-mail from an automatic Oracle workfow requesting the verification and approval for payment. The payment will only be performed once the approval is given. In case there is no response from the PO Owner, the workflow is escalated. 
The payment is triggered only after the Confirmation of Goods Receipt (3-way match) or Service approval. If the invoice is on Hold due to missing receipt/approval, an automatic e-mail is sent to the user/approver requesting action. 
Vendor Invoicing  Cancellation PO Requestors: validate all PO and vendor invoice information in order to avoid incorrect remittance.  If an error was identified after the invoice was issued, request the vendor the immediate proof of cancellation of the invoice.    </p>
<p>Confirmation, Approval and Payment (2 of 3) 
https://inside.amazon.com/en/services/finance/accountspayable/Pages/SA-AP.aspx <br />
If:  You are unsure of the invoice data The material doesn’t match what was ordered There are any inconsistencies with the purchase NEVER  confirm the receipt of a Good (3-way match) because of potential compliance issues 
ALWAYS  keep a close communication with the vendor in order to require any necessary corrections or cancellations on time. There is a DEADLINE FOR CANCELLATIONS according to local regulation. 
Invoice Receipt &amp; Validation  The Invoice Receipt team will verify, validate and ingest all data related to the invoice received by the Vendor versus the PO that was created by the PO Owner.   Payment  If all previous steps were correctly followed, your vendor should expect the payment on the agreed due date. The vendor can view the payment status in Payee Central. For Internal use:  Payee Central Training Guide Link   See pages 43-45 at the link   If there is any issue, a Ticket will be created and adressed to the PO Owner containing the issue description to be solved. The Payment will be kept On Hold until the issue is resolved.  </p>

WHO IS A CRITICAL VENDOR? A Critical Vendor can be defined as vendors who as a result of non/late payment of invoices could impact Amazon by: causing any of our buildings/office spaces to be unfit and/or unsafe for use causing reputational damage to Amazon or result in non-negotiable penalties/fees. disturbing traffic to Amazon websites or impairing our commitment to deliver customer orders on time. risk of service interruption affecting core operations TYPES OF CRITICAL VENDORS LATAM: Utility (Gas / Electric / Water / Waste / Etc.) Telecommunication (Voice Service / Data Circuits / Transit or Transport / Etc.)

CRITICAL VENDOR SUPPLIER ONBOARD The Critical Vendor Supplier Onboard must follow the general steps in Payee Central.  Exceptions: Government Critical Vendors. Check below: Non-Governmental Critical Vendor Onboard :  Vendor Managers are responsible for sending the invitation to the Vendors via Payee Central.        Governmental Critical Vendor Onboard :  Vendor Managers must fill NSQ Form and attach supporting offical documentation.           <br />

  What are the other methods &amp; systems used outside of Payee Central and when they are applicable NSQ –  The NSQ process was in place before Payee Central rollout. It is still ONLY valid for NGO (Non Governmental Organizations) and Public Sector payments (such as Critical Vendors). DO NOT set up a regular vendor creation via NSQ.<br />
NSQ Form &amp; Instructions:  https://inside.amazon.com/en/services/finance/accountspayable/Pages/NSQ.aspx  <br />
Contracting with NGOs:  https://legal.amazon.com/sites/LegalTeams/InternationalConsumerLegal/LiBra/Pages/ngos.aspx <br />
To request a Vendor Creation via NSQ, open a ticket in the following CTI: C – Accounts Payable – Vendor Maintenance T – Payee Set-up I – Payee Setup by NSQ – LATAM --- </p>

<p>Got it — I went through the <strong>Corporate Payments Master File Global Training</strong> deck you uploaded. Here’s a <strong>step-by-step quick-use checklist</strong> distilled from the training, so you can hit the ground running in Coupa without digging through every slide:</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="amazon-coupa-corporate-payments-quick-guide">📋 Amazon Coupa / Corporate Payments Quick Guide</h1>
<h2 id="1-first-principles">1. <strong>First Principles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>All corporate purchases (goods/services used internally, not resale inventory) must follow <strong>S&amp;TP Policy</strong>:  </li>
<li>Correct approvals in place.  </li>
<li>Right vendor setup.  </li>
<li>Compliance with tax/financial controls【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="2-roles-you-need-to-know">2. <strong>Roles You Need to Know</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>PO Owner</strong> → Creates and manages the purchase order end-to-end.  </li>
<li><strong>Vendor Manager</strong> → Handles vendor onboarding &amp; registration.  </li>
<li><strong>FinOps (Corp AP)</strong> → Processes payments if everything matches.  </li>
<li><strong>You (Requester)</strong> → Ensure details are correct so invoices don’t get stuck【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-vendor-onboarding-payee-central">3. <strong>Vendor Onboarding (Payee Central)</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Check if vendor already exists in <strong>Payee Central</strong>.  </li>
<li>If not → Vendor Manager sends invitation.  </li>
<li>Separate onboardings required if the vendor provides <strong>both Goods &amp; Services</strong>.  </li>
<li>Vendor must complete tax interview and training.  </li>
<li>Once set up, you’ll get the correct <strong>Supplier Code</strong> for POs【10†source】.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="4-creating-a-purchase-order">4. <strong>Creating a Purchase Order</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Decide <strong>One-time vs. Recurring</strong> (use Blanket PO if recurring).  </li>
<li>Enter details carefully:  </li>
<li>Supplier code (tax ID must match).  </li>
<li>Description, quantity, amount <strong>exactly as it will appear on invoice</strong>.  </li>
<li>Location &amp; GL String (must align with org/cost center).  </li>
<li>Correct PO Type:  <ul>
<li><strong>Goods</strong> = 3-way match (PO ↔ Receipt ↔ Invoice).  </li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> = 2-way match (PO ↔ Invoice).  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vendor <strong>must include the PO number</strong> on their invoice, or it will fail【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="5-vendor-invoicing">5. <strong>Vendor Invoicing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Invoice must:  </li>
<li>Include the PO number.  </li>
<li>Match PO details line-for-line (esp. for goods).  </li>
<li>Some countries require vendor to <strong>email PDF invoice</strong> directly.  </li>
<li>Errors (wrong PO, missing info) = payment delays【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="6-confirmation-payment">6. <strong>Confirmation &amp; Payment</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goods</strong> → PO Owner must confirm receipt in Coupa (3-way match).  </li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> → PO Owner must approve service completion when prompted.  </li>
<li>Only after confirmation will FinOps release payment.  </li>
<li>If something doesn’t match → invoice goes <strong>On Hold</strong> until corrected【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="7-most-common-issues">7. <strong>Most Common Issues</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QTY REC Hold (Goods not received in system)</strong> → Go into Coupa, click truck icon, confirm receipt.  </li>
<li><strong>PO Overbilled Hold</strong> → Add funds via Coupa “Request Change.”  </li>
<li><strong>Missing PO Number</strong> → Vendor must reissue invoice with correct PO【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="8-critical-vendors">8. <strong>Critical Vendors</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Utilities, telecom, building leases, employee benefits.  </li>
<li>Late/non-payment = severe impact (site shutdowns, reputational risk).  </li>
<li>These get priority handling【10†source】.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p>👉 That’s the <strong>whole flow boiled down</strong>:<br />
<strong>Onboard vendor → Create accurate PO → Vendor invoices w/ PO# → Confirm/Approve → FinOps pays.</strong></p>

<p>Do you want me to also build you a <strong>1-page “cheat sheet” PDF</strong> you can keep open while working in Coupa, with just the steps, common errors, and key links?</p>

<p>Nice — I got the archive unpacked. It’s a <strong>Cisco Secure Client DART bundle</strong>, which is basically a diagnostic package your VPN client generates. Here’s what’s inside at a high level:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="key-contents">📂 Key Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cisco Secure Client / AnyConnect VPN</strong></li>
<li><code>AnyConnectVPN.txt</code> &amp; <code>.evtx</code> → raw connection logs (session attempts, errors, disconnects).</li>
<li>
<p><code>preferences.xml</code> &amp; <code>amazon-default.xml</code> → saved VPN profiles &amp; server configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Core / Logs</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CiscoSecureClient.txt</code> &amp; <code>.evtx</code> → system-level logs about the VPN client itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DART Logs</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CiscoSecureClient-DART.txt</code> → summary diagnostics of client environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ISE Posture</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ISEPosture.txt</code> → checks whether your device passes corporate compliance policies (AV/firewall/updates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Firewall Posture</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple logs (<code>csc_cscan.log</code>, <code>WaDiagnose_clientfull.txt</code>, etc.) → firewall and endpoint scan results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Visibility Module</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NetworkVisibility.txt</code> → captures network telemetry (IP, DNS, ports in use).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Umbrella</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Umbrella.txt</code> → Cisco Umbrella (DNS security) status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero Trust Access</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ZeroTrustAccess.txt</code> → ZTA posture logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
</li>
<li><code>ipconfig_result.txt</code>, <code>netstat_result.txt</code>, <code>route_result.txt</code> → networking snapshots.</li>
<li><code>systeminfo_result.txt</code>, <code>msinfo.nfo</code> → full system info (OS, hardware, patch level).</li>
<li><code>hosts</code> file → custom host overrides.</li>
<li>
<p>Event logs (<code>System.evtx</code>, <code>Application.evtx</code>, <code>KernelBoot.evtx</code>, <code>TpmEvents.evtx</code>) → OS-level event traces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>summary.txt</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Usually a quick overview with detected issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-this-means">🧾 What This Means</h2>
<ul>
<li>This bundle is essentially a <strong>forensic footprint</strong> of your VPN client + network state at the time you ran diagnostics.  </li>
<li>It contains:</li>
<li>VPN connection attempts &amp; failures (good for troubleshooting drops).  </li>
<li>Compliance checks (why you might be blocked by corporate VPN).  </li>
<li>System and network config (which IPs, routes, adapters were active).  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>⚠️ Heads-up: these files can expose <strong>sensitive information</strong> (hostnames, IP addresses, VPN gateways, maybe Amazon-internal configs). Best not to share raw logs outside of secure review.</p>
<hr />
<p>👉 Do you want me to <strong>open and parse <code>summary.txt</code> + <code>AnyConnectVPN.txt</code></strong> first, so I can give you a concise diagnosis of why your VPN may have been failing?</p>

<p>Short answer: <strong>Yes—your device has been posture-checked when you connect (a form of remote monitoring for compliance).</strong> I don’t see evidence in this bundle of broader telemetry like Cisco Umbrella DNS logging or Network Visibility flow uploads.</p>
<p>Here’s what your logs show:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posture / HostScan is active and required.</strong> Your VPN asks the endpoint to report security state before/full access:</li>
<li><code>Posture Assessment: Required for access</code> and later <code>Posture Assessment: Active</code> (from <code>AnyConnectVPN.txt</code>).</li>
<li><code>Hostscan already complete after authentication</code> (from <code>AnyConnectVPN.txt</code>).</li>
<li>
<p>The Cisco Secure Firewall Posture (“cscan”) log enumerates your security products/versions (e.g., Windows Defender definitions and BitLocker presence), which are sent to the gateway to decide access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy controls in effect (but not Always-On).</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>ConnectFailurePolicy: Closed</strong> (from the VPN log) → if the client can’t reach VPN when required, network access is <strong>restricted</strong>.</li>
<li>
<p>Profile flags: <code>AutoConnectOnStart: false</code>, <code>LocalLanAccess: false</code>, <code>EnableScripting: true</code> (from <code>amazon-default.xml</code>). That means no auto-connect at startup, local LAN is blocked while on VPN, and post-connect scripts can run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What I did <em>not</em> find:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Umbrella (DNS roaming client):</strong> no hits in any logs.</li>
<li><strong>Network Visibility Module (NVM) flow uploads:</strong> the bundle contains a “Network Visibility Module/Logs” file, but it’s just event stubs; I found <strong>no entries indicating NVM session/collector uploads</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Always-On VPN:</strong> not enabled (<code>AlwaysOn: false</code> in policy/effective logs).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-this-means-in-practice">What this means in practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your company can see <strong>when you connect, where you connect from, device identifiers, and the HostScan/ISE posture results</strong> (AV status, disk encryption, firewall, etc.). That’s standard compliance monitoring.</li>
<li>I don’t see evidence here of <strong>DNS/web activity monitoring via Cisco Umbrella</strong> or <strong>flow telemetry via NVM</strong>. If those were enabled and active, we’d normally see explicit module entries.</li>
<li>Anything you do <strong>through the VPN</strong> traverses Amazon’s network; traffic to corporate resources is, by nature, observable on their side.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, I can pull a clean, time-ordered mini-report from the logs (connects/disconnects + posture checks + policy notes) so you have a one-pager you can hand to IT or keep for your records.</p>

<p>no need just curious if ive been directly monitored yet and it sounds like i have not so thats cool</p>

<p>Exactly — you haven’t had full-on <em>traffic monitoring</em> (like Umbrella DNS logging or Network Visibility flow exports) turned on, at least from what this bundle shows.  </p>
<p>What <strong>has</strong> happened is the standard <strong>VPN posture check</strong> every time you connect — the system remotely queries your machine to make sure AV, firewall, and disk encryption are in place. That’s compliance enforcement, not full surveillance.  </p>
<p>So: ✅ posture scans, ❌ no signs of deeper always-on monitoring.  </p>
<p>Would you like me to show you the specific posture items it checked on your machine (like Defender, firewall, BitLocker) so you know exactly what Amazon can see?</p>
