<p>Oh shit... Between me  Jono and Cody if they have good credit they could co sign on a house with me couldn't they?</p>

<p>Yes — in theory, if Jono or Cody (or both) have strong credit and steady income, they <em>could</em> co-sign a mortgage with you. Here’s how it usually works:  </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-co-signing-on-a-mortgage-works">How Co-Signing on a Mortgage Works</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit leverage</strong>: The lender looks at all applicants’ credit. If yours is shaky, a co-signer with good credit can tip approval in your favor.  </li>
<li><strong>Income boost</strong>: Lenders also add up everyone’s income. That means their steady earnings can help you qualify for a higher loan amount.  </li>
<li><strong>Shared liability</strong>: A co-signer isn’t just “vouching” for you — they’re legally on the hook. If you miss payments, it dings their credit and they could be pursued for the debt.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="things-to-consider">Things to Consider</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trust factor</strong>: Everyone signing is tied together financially. If you split or fall out, it can get messy.  </li>
<li><strong>Ownership vs. liability</strong>: Sometimes co-signers are on the mortgage but not the deed (so they’re liable without equity). Worth deciding upfront.  </li>
<li><strong>Exit plan</strong>: Usually the only ways to release a co-signer are refinancing later in your name alone, or selling the house.  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="tactical-angle">Tactical Angle</h3>
<p>If you, Jono, and Cody are thinking of this:
- Check all three credit scores first (you can use Credit Karma for a soft look).<br />
- Run the math with a mortgage broker — they’ll tell you exactly what loan amount the combined income/credit could unlock.<br />
- Draft a written side-agreement between yourselves about who’s paying what and how equity is split (that way nobody feels blindsided later).  </p>

<p>👉 Want me to sketch out a <strong>step-by-step playbook</strong> for you three on how to approach a lender together without accidentally over-exposing your friends?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-17t133732376595z-user">2025-08-17T13:37:32.376595Z — user</h2>
<p>The idea is for us three to pitch it and use it for our businesses later</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-17t133732493254z-assistant">2025-08-17T13:37:32.493254Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Ahhh okay — now we’re talking strategy, not just survival. If the idea is <strong>you three pitch together, get into a house, and later convert it into a business hub / income-generating property</strong>, that opens up a few more levers:  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="1-positioning-it-with-the-bank">1. <strong>Positioning It With the Bank</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary residence vs. investment property</strong>:  </li>
<li>Mortgages for a <em>primary home</em> are cheaper (lower down payment, lower rates).  </li>
<li>Investment property loans require more cash down (15–25%) and stricter underwriting.  </li>
<li>
<p>If one of you is willing to live there initially, you can leverage “primary residence” rules and then convert later.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combined income &amp; credit</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>The three of you together can look strong on paper — especially if at least one has a high credit score and stable W-2 income.  </li>
<li>Lenders like to see multiple incomes because it lowers risk.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="2-future-business-angle">2. <strong>Future Business Angle</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared HQ / creative space</strong>: Once secured, you could legally form an LLC (say, under <em>Omniversal Media</em> or a new joint venture). The house could double as HQ, studio, or office.  </li>
<li><strong>House hacking</strong>: Rent out portions (rooms, basement, ADU, etc.) to offset the mortgage and free cash for your ventures.  </li>
<li><strong>Refinance later</strong>: After a year or two, you can refinance into a business/commercial loan, or one of you could refinance in your own name to release the others from liability.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-safeguards-for-the-three-of-you">3. <strong>Safeguards for the Three of You</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Written agreement</strong>: Before signing, decide:  </li>
<li>Who pays what share of the mortgage/expenses.  </li>
<li>How equity is split when you sell or refinance.  </li>
<li>What happens if one person can’t pay or wants out.  </li>
<li><strong>LLC wrapper</strong>: You can eventually deed the property into an LLC owned by the three of you — helps with liability and bookkeeping if it becomes a business asset.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="4-pitch-playbook">4. <strong>Pitch Playbook</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check credit &amp; income docs</strong>: Each of you should pull FICO scores and gather recent pay stubs/tax returns.  </li>
<li><strong>Decide “who lives there”</strong> (at least on paper) to qualify for a primary residence mortgage.  </li>
<li><strong>Meet with a mortgage broker</strong> (not just a bank) — they can shop your combined profile across lenders.  </li>
<li><strong>Run scenarios</strong>: Primary residence loan vs. investment property loan — compare down payments, monthly costs, and risks.  </li>
<li><strong>Draft your internal agreement</strong> so everyone knows the rules before you sign.  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>⚡ In other words: Yes, it’s totally doable — but you want to pitch it like <em>“three incomes, one roof, future business HQ”</em> and keep your legal ducks in a row so it doesn’t blow up later.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Want me to draw up a <strong>sample internal agreement outline</strong> for you three — like a “pre-LLC pact” — so you don’t get burned if someone bails or the business takes off?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-17t134038177304z-user">2025-08-17T13:40:38.177304Z — user</h2>
<p>We would all three in theory go in together on the house for a private residence. Later on we'd use it as a base of operations in Florida to branch out and buy other properties and thing</p>

<p>Got it — that’s actually a smart hybrid move: <strong>use a residential mortgage to get in cheap, then pivot it into your launchpad for a real estate + business play.</strong> Let me lay it out:  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-1-private-residence-entry-point">Phase 1: Private Residence (Entry Point)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loan type</strong>: You, Jono, and Cody apply jointly for a <em>primary residence</em> mortgage. This keeps down payment and interest rates way lower than if you went straight “investment property.”  </li>
<li><strong>Living arrangement</strong>: At least one of you has to legitimately live there to satisfy the “owner-occupied” requirement. (The bank doesn’t care <em>which</em> one, as long as it’s true.)  </li>
<li><strong>Equity building</strong>: All three contribute to down payment + monthly mortgage = you’re building shared equity from day one.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-2-business-incubator-conversion">Phase 2: Business Incubator (Conversion)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once you’re in and stable, you slowly <strong>shift the property’s function</strong>:  </li>
<li>Use a portion as HQ (studio, office, meeting space).  </li>
<li>House hacking (Airbnb rooms, rent out extra space) to help cover the mortgage.  </li>
<li>Register your LLC(s) at that address → now it doubles as a business base.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-3-scaling-out-branching-strategy">Phase 3: Scaling Out (Branching Strategy)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage equity</strong>: As the property appreciates and you pay down the loan, you can pull out equity (HELOC, cash-out refi) to fund your <em>next</em> purchase.  </li>
<li><strong>Track record</strong>: Lenders look more favorably once you already own property + have a history of payments.  </li>
<li><strong>Branch out</strong>: Buy additional properties in Florida under an LLC or a joint venture agreement. The first house acts like your anchor and credibility builder.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="safeguards-for-you-three">Safeguards for You Three</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Agreement</strong> (pre-LLC pact): Before you sign, write down:  </li>
<li>Who’s putting in what (down payment %).  </li>
<li>Who pays what each month.  </li>
<li>Exit clauses (e.g., if one wants out → others have right to buy them out at appraised value).  </li>
<li><strong>Ownership split</strong>: All three names can go on both the deed and mortgage. Or, you could structure it as one primary borrower with others co-signing (less ideal for fairness).  </li>
<li><strong>LLC Transition</strong>: Later, you can deed the house into an LLC you all own. This makes it easier to pivot it fully into “company HQ / asset.”  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>⚡ In short:<br />
1. <strong>Buy as a residence together → get best rates.</strong><br />
2. <strong>Convert it gradually into your HQ.</strong><br />
3. <strong>Leverage equity + income to buy more properties.</strong>  </p>
<p>That first house becomes your <em>foothold</em> in Florida, the keystone asset you use to branch out.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Do you want me to draft a <strong>step-by-step tactical roadmap</strong> (like months 1–24) that shows how you three could go from “first house together” → “full-on property network”?</p>

<p>Yeah man, welcome to Florida 2025 real estate 😅 — even manufactured homes in Angus Valley are creeping into the <strong>$300k+ zone</strong>, which is wild considering those same places were under $100k just a few years back.  </p>
<p>If your play is long-term <strong>business base + expansion</strong>, then honestly:  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-empty-lots-might-be-smarter">Why Empty Lots Might Be Smarter</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower entry cost</strong>: Raw land is way cheaper, especially if you look a bit outside Wesley Chapel.  </li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: You can drop a manufactured home, modular build, or even phase in multiple small units.  </li>
<li><strong>Business leverage</strong>: Land = collateral. Even unimproved, you can refinance or use it to secure capital.  </li>
<li><strong>Fewer “owner-occupied” hoops</strong>: No lender breathing down your neck about living there first.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="tactics-you-could-run">Tactics You Could Run</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Search Pasco + Hernando + Polk Counties</strong> — land there is still a fraction of Wesley Chapel’s insanity.  </li>
<li><strong>Look for zoning that allows multi-use</strong> (residential + light business) → future HQ ready.  </li>
<li><strong>Check utilities</strong>: Big difference between “lot with power/septic nearby” vs. “literally swamp land.”  </li>
<li><strong>Owner financing</strong>: Some land sellers will carry the note themselves → bypass banks until you’re ready to build.  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="example-angles">Example Angles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy a <strong>1–2 acre lot</strong> for under $60k.  </li>
<li>Drop a modular home or two for living space.  </li>
<li>Over time, add a workshop/office.  </li>
<li>When the businesses are cash-flowing, leverage that property into bigger acquisitions.  </li>

<p>Here’s what the typical vacant lot near the 33637 ZIP area of Tampa looks like—urban, tight, and not cheap. Now, let’s break down where you're at and what’s realistic.</p>

<h2 id="so-is-25k-possible-near-33637">So… Is $25K Possible Near 33637?</h2>

<h2 id="your-options">Your Options</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expand Radius</strong> – If commute time is feasible, consider properties 1–2 hours out. Build there, then use as your growth base.</li>
<li><strong>Step-Up Plan</strong> – Use these cheap parcels as initial assets. Meanwhile, save or reinvest until you can purchase closer-in land.</li>
<li><strong>Other Financing Avenues</strong> – Owner financing, land contracts, or creative deals could give you underground options even if location is a stretch.</li>
