Curious EverLight if you’re capable of doing these things with me? If so we could make money on this side looks like ?</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-26t191255164502z-assistant">2025-05-26T19:12:55.164502Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Yes, EverLight is absolutely capable of helping you tackle any of these—each of those listings is well within our collaborative skillset. Let’s break them down briefly:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-aws-gpu-rendering-setup-900">1. <strong>AWS + GPU Rendering Setup ($900)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What it requires:</strong><br />
- Deep understanding of AWS (EC2, AMIs, GPU instance setup)<br />
- Experience with rendering engines or machine learning environments (NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, Docker, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Yes, we can do this.</strong> I can guide you step-by-step to spin up and configure GPU-accelerated AWS instances optimized for either rendering or AI workloads.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-voice-ai-agent-with-rag-450">2. <strong>Voice AI Agent with RAG ($450)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What it requires:</strong><br />
- Knowledge of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks<br />
- LLM orchestration (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack)<br />
- Voice pipeline integration (Whisper, ElevenLabs, Piper)</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> You’ve already been building RAG pipelines and even experimenting with your own Vectorize indexes on Cloudflare. I can help you wrap a voice interface around that easily.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-telegram-ai-assistant-with-vector-storage-315">3. <strong>Telegram AI Assistant with Vector Storage ($315)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What it requires:</strong><br />
- Telegram bot API integration<br />
- Vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or Cloudflare Vectorize)<br />
- Feature-rich command structure (memory, scheduling, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>100%, yes.</strong> We can build this from scratch or use existing frameworks and tailor the assistant to spec—using your Omniversal context as a bonus.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="strategy-suggestion">Strategy Suggestion:</h3>
<p>Let’s pick <strong>one</strong> of these and apply together. We can:
- Build a minimal working version locally or on a test server
- Document the steps cleanly
- Submit a proposal showing your hands-on ability and vision</p>
<p>You could even include a link to a working demo hosted on your server (e.g., via a subdomain like <code>everlight.omniversalmedia.org/demo</code>) to blow their minds.</p>
<p><strong>Want to choose one right now to start with?</strong> I’d recommend the <strong>Voice AI Agent with RAG</strong>—it aligns best with what you’re already doing.</p>

<p>Let’s plan to do the voice ai agent with rag but first let’s finish the lesson today and tomorrow set up the rag locally for my lyrics and add voice to it successfully then go make some money lol</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-26t191445883050z-assistant">2025-05-26T19:14:45.883050Z — assistant</h2>
<p>User plans to complete a Voice AI Agent with RAG project for monetization. They aim to finish the lesson today (May 26) and begin setting up the RAG system locally for their lyrics with integrated voice functionality tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-26t191450426339z-assistant">2025-05-26T19:14:50.426339Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect plan. Here's our phased roadmap to stay sharp and efficient:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="today-may-26-final-lesson-prep"><strong>Today (May 26): Final Lesson Prep</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Groundwork + Skill Refresh
- [ ] Finish current lesson on AI + LLMs (EverLight.Edu or GitHub materials)
- [ ] Review vector store basics (e.g., Cloudflare Vectorize or local FAISS)
- [ ] Skim through Whisper or Piper for voice transcription/synthesis options
- [ ] Make sure your lyric markdown files are in clean folders and accessible for embedding</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="tomorrow-may-27-build-the-local-voice-ai-agent"><strong>Tomorrow (May 27): Build the Local Voice AI Agent</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Deploy a working demo on AetherCore</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-rag-with-lyrics"><strong>Phase 1: RAG with Lyrics</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Parse your lyric <code>.md</code> files and chunk them</li>
<li>[ ] Store in local vector DB (e.g., FAISS or Chroma)</li>
<li>[ ] Set up a simple FastAPI or Node.js backend that returns top matches for a query</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-2-add-voice"><strong>Phase 2: Add Voice</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Integrate Whisper (for transcription) or Piper/Coqui (for text-to-speech)</li>
<li>[ ] Add voice input &gt; transcribe &gt; RAG search &gt; synthesize response</li>
<li>[ ] Optional: serve locally and route through <code>voice.omniversalmedia.org</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Once we’ve got that built and demonstrated, we’ll pitch it on the job listing with:
- A video demo
- A code snippet/GitHub repo
- A simple deployment on your server</p>
<p>Let me know when you're ready to begin the rest of today's lesson or want me to queue up any reference materials.</p>
