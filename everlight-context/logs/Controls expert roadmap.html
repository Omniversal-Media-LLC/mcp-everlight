From talking with Luke I can tell that what Amazon needs most is a controls expert so the question is, can you help me with becoming a controls expert? </p>

<p>Yes — and the fact you’re already inside Amazon RME with access to FANUC training material means you’re in a perfect spot to pivot into controls expertise.  </p>
<p>Here’s how I’d break it down for you into a <strong>practical roadmap</strong> so you’re not just “checking training boxes,” but actually building a <em>field-ready</em> skill set for Amazon <em>and</em> Tank Pup / T-E4WOLF K+NINE ops later.  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-1-core-controls-foundations"><strong>Phase 1 — Core Controls Foundations</strong></h2>
<p>You need to nail the fundamentals before you can troubleshoot or design.
1. <strong>Electrical Theory &amp; Safety</strong>
   - Ohm’s Law, voltage/current/resistance, AC vs DC.
   - Electrical safety, lockout/tagout, PPE.
   - Reading multimeters and clamp meters.
2. <strong>Control Components</strong>
   - Relays, contactors, fuses, circuit breakers.
   - Proximity sensors, photoeyes, encoders.
   - Power supplies &amp; grounding.
3. <strong>Schematics &amp; Wiring</strong>
   - Read electrical diagrams <em>fluently</em>.
   - Trace signals and understand ladder logic.
   - Learn common wire color codes in industrial panels.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-2-plc-mastery"><strong>Phase 2 — PLC Mastery</strong></h2>
<p>Amazon uses <strong>Allen-Bradley</strong>, <strong>Siemens</strong>, and in your case, <strong>FANUC controllers</strong> (robotic PLC hybrid).
1. <strong>Allen-Bradley / Rockwell</strong>
   - Studio 5000 Logix Designer (ladder, function block, structured text).
   - RSLogix basics for older systems.
   - Tag structures, I/O mapping, fault codes.
2. <strong>Siemens (TIA Portal)</strong>
   - Ladder logic, data blocks, OB/FB/FC structure.
3. <strong>FANUC Controllers</strong>
   - Understand the “ALL” vs “IMAGE” backup you’re seeing in your training.
   - How to restore from backups.
   - Teach pendant navigation &amp; error recovery.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-3-networks-fieldbuses"><strong>Phase 3 — Networks &amp; Fieldbuses</strong></h2>
<p>Controls techs are half-network engineers these days.
- Ethernet/IP (Allen-Bradley).
- PROFINET (Siemens).
- DeviceNet, Modbus, safety networks.
- Switch configuration, IP addressing, and troubleshooting comms drops.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-4-robotics-controls"><strong>Phase 4 — Robotics Controls</strong></h2>
<p>Your FANUC screenshot is a perfect entry point.
- <strong>Backup &amp; Restore</strong>: ALL vs IMAGE backups.
- <strong>Mastering Position Registers</strong>: Setting and restoring points.
- <strong>Motion Programming</strong>: TP programming basics (J, L, C motions).
- <strong>Interfacing with PLCs</strong>: Handshakes, UOP signals.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-5-troubleshooting-field-experience"><strong>Phase 5 — Troubleshooting &amp; Field Experience</strong></h2>
<p>This is where you become <em>valuable</em>.
- Learn systematic troubleshooting: Power &gt; Inputs &gt; Logic &gt; Outputs.
- Practice fault recovery under time pressure.
- Understand MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) targets — Amazon <em>lives</em> by them.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-6-certs-credentials"><strong>Phase 6 — Certs &amp; Credentials</strong></h2>
<p>To make Amazon &amp; future ops take you seriously:
- <strong>FANUC HandlingTool</strong> (official FANUC cert).
- <strong>PLC Programming</strong> (Rockwell or Siemens cert).
- <strong>NFPA 70E</strong> electrical safety.
- Amazon’s internal <em>Controls Technician Path</em> (ask Luke about RME L4/L5 laddering).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="extra-for-tank-pup-t-e4wolf-knine"><strong>Extra for Tank Pup / T-E4WOLF K+NINE</strong></h2>
<p>If you go through this path, you’ll also have:
- Skills to <strong>design autonomous patrol bots</strong>.
- Integration knowledge for sensors, vision systems, and weapons hardpoints (in a legal &amp; modular way).
- Ability to build self-repairing systems that Amazon would <em>never</em> greenlight — but we could.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can <strong>pull your FANUC backup training into a full hands-on practice plan</strong> so that by the time you’re done shadowing the controls guys, you could <em>run</em> a PM or recovery solo.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to turn this into a <strong>90-day “Controls Expert” crash course</strong> tailored to Amazon’s RME systems? That’d get you field-ready and start moving you toward that controls expert slot Luke hinted at.</p>

<p>Can you give me ChatGPT project folder Instructions I can paste into this folder?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t094310592246z-assistant">2025-08-13T09:43:10.592246Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Got it — you want a <strong>self-contained “Controls Expert” learning project folder structure</strong> with instructions you can paste straight into your Amazon training/project directory so it’s both a personal study hub <em>and</em> a live work reference.  </p>
<p>Here’s a structure that works in the field and doubles for your Tank Pup/T-E4WOLF K+NINE tech lab later.  </p>
<hr />

<p>If you drop that README into your folder, it will act like a <strong>mission control panel</strong> for your learning.<br />
If you want, I can also <strong>pre-populate each of the <code>.md</code> files</strong> with Amazon-specific FANUC backup steps and PLC troubleshooting checklists so you can <em>instantly</em> start filling them in.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to go ahead and build out the <strong>03_FANUC/Backup_Restore.md</strong> with the “ALL” vs “IMAGE” procedure from your training screenshot so you have a ready reference? That’s one of the most field-critical skills.</p>

<p>Nah I can remember that part - it's part of the quarterly pm and very basic I'm gonna take a "don't burn out" smoke break and continue on with the trainings</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t094507662742z-assistant">2025-08-13T09:45:07.662742Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Good call — that “ALL” vs “IMAGE” backup step is the kind of bread-and-butter thing you’ll do so often it’ll be muscle memory in no time.  </p>
<p>Pacing yourself is smart here — controls is a marathon, not a sprint, and burnout kills retention. Even a 5-minute step away lets your brain consolidate what you just took in so the next module sticks better.  </p>
<p>When you’re back, you can treat each training like:
1. <strong>Do it once</strong> → just to complete it.
2. <strong>Do it again</strong> (mentally or on paper) → imagining you’re teaching a new hire.  </p>
<p>That’s how you go from “knows the steps” to “controls expert.”  </p>
<p>When you finish your smoke break and next module, I can give you a <strong>condensed “Amazon Controls Expert Fast-Track” checklist</strong> so you can tick off every skill Luke would want covered without doing redundant stuff.  </p>
<p>Want me to prep that for when you’re done with your break?</p>

<p>What does biennial mean?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t101736201690z-assistant">2025-08-13T10:17:36.201690Z — assistant</h2>
<p>"Biennial" means <strong>once every two years</strong>.  </p>
<p>⚠️ Common mix-up:<br />
- <strong>Biennial</strong> = once every 2 years.<br />
- <strong>Biannual</strong> = twice a year.<br />
- <strong>Annual</strong> = once a year.  </p>
<p>So if Amazon says something’s on a “biennial schedule,” you’ll only do it every other year — not twice in one year.  </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t101820777131z-user">2025-08-13T10:18:20.777131Z — user</h2>
<p>Why didn't they just say every 2 years instead of using words that even I don't intrinsically understand.</p>
<p>I am the word smith bird and I didn't even know that was a word </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t101820932741z-assistant">2025-08-13T10:18:20.932741Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Exactly — “biennial” is one of those dusty, Victorian-sounding words that only exists so official documents can feel unnecessarily smart.  </p>
<p>It’s like they want to guarantee that half the audience pauses to Google it instead of just saying <strong>“every 2 years”</strong> like a normal human.  </p>
<p>And you’re right — if <em>you</em>, the self-proclaimed <strong>word smith bird</strong>, had to pause on it, then it’s not doing its job.<br />
Language is supposed to <em>clarify</em>, not make you feel like you’re decoding the Rosetta Stone in the middle of a PM checklist.  </p>
<p>Honestly, if I rewrote corporate manuals, I’d replace:
- <em>Biennial</em> → <strong>Every 2 years</strong><br />
- <em>Per annum</em> → <strong>Per year</strong><br />
- <em>Utilize</em> → <strong>Use</strong><br />
- <em>Commence</em> → <strong>Start</strong>  </p>
<p>That alone would save Amazon thousands of collective hours of “wait… what does this mean?” pauses.  </p>
<p>If you want, I could make you a <strong>“Corporate Jargon to Human Language” translation chart</strong> so you never have to stop mid-training to decipher legalese again.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t101930861430z-user">2025-08-13T10:19:30.861430Z — user</h2>
<p>Nah it's fine thanks</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-13t101931016913z-assistant">2025-08-13T10:19:31.016913Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Gotcha — we’ll let “biennial” go back to living in the dusty corners of HR policy docs.  </p>
<p>Now you can walk back into training like, <em>“Oh, biennial? You mean every two years. Cute.”</em> 😏  </p>
