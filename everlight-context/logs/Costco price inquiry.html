<p>Hi there! Just to clarify—are you asking whether you can buy something at Costco for <strong>$1.50</strong>? If so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a specific item in mind (like a snack, drink, or accessory)?</li>
<li>Or are you referring to a rumored $1.50 price for a well-known Costco item (e.g. the famous food court hot dog + drink combo, which is actually $1.99)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know what you're thinking, and I can look up the latest pricing or menu details for you!</p>

<p>You're absolutely on target — Costco is famous for offering a food court <strong>hot dog and soda combo priced at just $1.50 in the U.S.</strong>, a deal that has remained unchanged since <strong>1985</strong> citeturn0search28turn0search30turn0search0turn0search8. This combo includes a <strong>quarter-pound all‑beef Kirkland Signature hot dog</strong> and a <strong>20 oz fountain drink</strong> with free refills citeturn0search28turn0news24turn0search2turn0search3.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why this deal sticks around:</strong>
- The combo is considered a <strong>loss leader</strong>, designed to bring customers into the store and reinforce Costco’s message of unbeatable value citeturn0search28turn0search30turn0news25turn0search3.
- Costco built its own hot dog production facilities in California and Illinois to cut costs and maintain the low price long term citeturn0search30turn0search29turn0news24.
- As of <strong>May 2024</strong>, Costco’s finance leadership reaffirmed their commitment to keeping the combo at $1.50 “forever,” though the departure of the longtime CFO has caused some concern among fans citeturn0search30turn0search28turn0news22turn0news25.</p>
<p><strong>Important 2025 Change:</strong><br />
Costco has also announced it is switching its food court soda fountains from Pepsi back to <strong>Coca‑Cola products</strong>, beginning in early 2025. The rollout started in some locations in spring and is expected to be completed by summer or fall — but the cost of the combo remains unchanged at $1.50 citeturn0news16turn0news17turn0search7turn0search0.</p>
<p>So to answer your question: <strong>Yes</strong>, you can still get a hot dog and refillable drink at Costco’s U.S. food court for just <strong>$1.50</strong>.</p>
