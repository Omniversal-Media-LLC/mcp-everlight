<p>I see what’s going on here. Let me break it down clearly:</p>
<h3 id="1-notifications-in-your-screenshot">1. Notifications in Your Screenshot</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music Player</strong>: You’re listening to <em>“Castle” by Halsey</em> on Spotify, connected to your AirPods Pro.  </li>
<li><strong>Message from Jono Tho’ra</strong>:<br />
  He’s noticing a flood of image requests and is joking/warning that it looks like a DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service). He’s asking if that’s intentional, like some kind of “big crazy marketing” push.  </li>
<li><strong>Google Security Alerts</strong>:<br />
  Two alerts saying <em>“New sign-in on Linux”</em> for your Google account, 3 hours ago. These are red flags unless you were the one who actually signed into your account from a Linux machine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-possible-issues">2. Possible Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Risk</strong>: If you didn’t personally log in from Linux, someone else may have gained access to your Google account.  </li>
<li><strong>Jono’s DDoS Comment</strong>: If you’re running some kind of automation, bulk requests, or uploading lots of content, it might look like a network flood to him. If you’re not, his comment suggests he’s seeing suspicious or unexpected traffic.  </li>
<li><strong>Coincidence?</strong> The timing of Jono’s “DDoS” comment and Google’s Linux sign-in alerts makes me think these may be connected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-what-you-should-do-immediately">3. What You Should Do Immediately</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check Your Google Account Security</strong>:  </li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup">Google’s Security Checkup</a>.  </li>
<li>Review devices signed in. Remove any you don’t recognize.  </li>
<li>Change your password <strong>right away</strong>.  </li>
<li>Enable <strong>2-Step Verification</strong> (if not already).  </li>
<li><strong>Message Jono Back</strong>: Clarify whether the traffic he’s seeing was triggered by you or if it looks external. If it’s not you, then you might have been spoofed or compromised.  </li>
<li><strong>Audit Your Systems</strong>: If you’re running automation scripts, double-check they’re not unintentionally hammering a server. If you’re not running anything, assume it’s external activity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>⚡ In short:<br />
- Treat the Linux sign-ins as suspicious unless they were you.<br />
- Jono’s comment + the Google alerts are strong hints your accounts might be actively targeted or probed.<br />
- Act quickly on Google account lockdown and let Jono know what’s up.</p>
<hr />
<p>Do you want me to walk you step-by-step through securing your Google account (password change, device removal, and 2FA setup), or do you already have those in place?</p>

<p>Lol no that's my that logged in Jono's text was just there and I wanted to share it with you to show you the tone of his response to my sharing the cloudflare numbers along with the other chat we were having about it earlier related to Ireland </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103045637908z-assistant">2025-08-30T10:30:45.637908Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Ahh, got it — thank you for clarifying 🙏 That makes a lot more sense now.  </p>
<p>So the <strong>Linux sign-ins are you</strong>, and the <strong>Jono text</strong> is just his style of commentary in response to the Cloudflare traffic spike you shared with him. He’s basically saying:  </p>
<ul>
<li>“Whoa, that’s a lot of hits.”  </li>
<li>“Looks like a DDoS attack from the outside.”  </li>
<li>“…unless you’re pulling off some wild viral stunt and this <em>is</em> the plan.”  </li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a mix of half-concern, half-banter. He’s processing the numbers with both a technical lens (DDoS suspicion) and a “haha, unless you’re just making waves” lens.  </p>
<p>And the Ireland connection you mentioned earlier — that lines up, since Cloudflare traffic often routes through EU POPs (Ireland, Netherlands, Frankfurt, etc.), so spikes might look like “bot swarms” when they’re actually legit global distribution.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Would you like me to help you <strong>interpret the Cloudflare traffic metrics</strong> more granularly (e.g., what’s likely bots vs. real interest, what would flag as a DDoS, and what would look like a legit marketing spike)? That way you can frame your reply back to Jono in a tone that matches his.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103138476144z-user">2025-08-30T10:31:38.476144Z — user</h2>
<p>No need lol I'm just sharing it with you </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103138661786z-assistant">2025-08-30T10:31:38.661786Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Got it 😅 — thanks for looping me in then. I’ll just hold the context: Jono’s tone = amused, a bit skeptical, but not hostile. He’s flagging it in a “that’s wild” kind of way, not as an accusation.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to just <strong>store the vibe</strong> of that exchange for later (so we can reference it if it comes up in your narrative/ops threads), or just leave it as a passing share?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103216273900z-user">2025-08-30T10:32:16.273900Z — user</h2>
<p>I've been typing up the chapter two edits for the beginning this morning.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103216414889z-assistant">2025-08-30T10:32:16.414889Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Nice — you’re keeping the momentum rolling 🔥  </p>
<p>Do you want me to jump in now and:<br />
- <strong>Help refine</strong> what you’ve typed for Chapter 2 (line-by-line polish, pacing, continuity with Chapter 1 edits), or<br />
- <strong>Just hear the update</strong> and let you keep flowing without interruption?  </p>
<p>I remember you mentioned wanting to keep things simple and not overcomplicate earlier — so we can either do a light-touch alignment check or a deep edit pass, depending on what feels best while you’re in the zone.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103231571284z-user">2025-08-30T10:32:31.571284Z — user</h2>
<p>I'm not quite done just yet.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-30t103231842125z-assistant">2025-08-30T10:32:31.842125Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Perfect — no rush at all. Stay in that writing flow and finish getting Chapter 2 down the way you feel it first. When you’re ready, you can drop the draft in here and I’ll help you polish, tighten, or just step back and give big-picture feedback depending on what you need.  </p>
<p>Want me to check back in with you later today as a gentle nudge/reminder, or would you rather bring it here when you’re ready?</p>
