<p>Take an existing song or poem and refine its structure, rhythm, and impact while keeping the core message intact.</p>

<p>Absolutely—let’s do that. Please provide the song or poem you'd like me to refine, or let me know if you'd like me to choose one for you. If you're providing one, you can paste the lyrics or poem here, and I’ll enhance its structure, rhythm, and overall impact while preserving the heart of its message.</p>
<p>If you're asking me to choose, I can select a public domain poem or lyrics and work from there. Just let me know your preference.</p>
