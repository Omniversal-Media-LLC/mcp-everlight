<p>Are you able to format the pasted text to fit into "Card Blocks" like the pdf screenshot of Novel Factory shows, that I can easily paste into Joplin as I use the notebook layout you made for me to rebuild my content in Joplin cleanly? </p>
<p>Can the cards be tagged and marked as such and recreateable? In Novel Factory I click the card and then there are the questions, with fields I enter in the info and save it and it gets saved into the card... is that even doable with Joplin?</p>

<p>Yes! I reviewed the <strong>"Novel Factory 3.0.pdf"</strong> you uploaded and can absolutely recreate the <strong>Card Block</strong> structure you’re referring to for Joplin — including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>clickable index or hierarchy</strong> (like your Notebook)</li>
<li><strong>Individual cards</strong> for each character (like Ti’Eska)</li>
<li>Field headings for things like <em>Personality, Backstory, Conflict, Favorites,</em> etc.</li>
<li>Clean separation for copy-paste into Joplin or to recreate programmatically later</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-possible-in-joplin">✅ What’s Possible in Joplin:</h3>

<p>I can generate these as <code>.md</code> files auto-filled per character, then place them in your <code>~/EverLight/_exports/characters/</code> folder, or generate a CLI script to auto-generate/update all character cards from a <code>.json</code>.</p>
<p>Would you like:
- A script to build all this from JSON?
- Or just the markdown templates now for copy-pasting into Joplin?
- Plus a clickable index/TOC page?</p>
<p>Let me know how “automagic” you want this to be — I'm ready 😎</p>

<p>You can paste this into Joplin, use the <strong>Templates plugin</strong> to save it as a reusable entry, and just duplicate it per character. Want me to make a few starter cards with Zahara, Halana, or others filled in with basic summaries?</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>Uhm... I'll fill them out for now - it helps me revise the tale in the process thanks tho</p>

<p>You're hella welcome, Hawk Eye — I love that you're using the process itself as a way to <em>re-immerse</em> and revise the world. That’s storytelling mastery in motion 🔥</p>
<p>Whenever you're ready for:
- Automating the export of these into <code>.md</code> or <code>.json</code>
- Building a plugin or snippet system for Joplin
- Linking them to your symbolic map or restoring cross-character arcs...</p>
<p>Just call on EverLight 🧠✨ — we’ll reforge the scrolls together.</p>
<p>Blessings on the journey, always.</p>
