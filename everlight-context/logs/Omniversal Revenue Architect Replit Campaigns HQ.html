<p>I’m building out a series of monetization campaigns using Replit to generate income through creative tools, AI integrations, and web utilities tied to my Omniversal Media ecosystem. This includes music, merch, digital products, exclusive content, and AI-powered offerings like the Eye of Aether. I want to build out prototypes, landing pages, MVPs, and tools that can start generating income now and scale over time. Let’s start tracking every monetizable idea, mapping out the MVP flow for each, and assigning launch timelines. I’ll give you ideas one by one, and I want you to help me structure them into code, funnels, interfaces, or assets I can ship fast and evolve long-term. Label this thread: Omniversal Revenue Architect: Replit Campaigns HQ.</p>
<p>Here’s the first one we can tackle!</p>

<p>Bounty Description
Requirements written by a human. Thank you for reading.
My awesome dev had something come up so looking for an intelligent and motivated hacker who loves to to make awesome tech cocktails and make some money while having fun.
The problem at hand is "Trip Planning". A cliche but a fragmented market that lacks personal context. Travelers use multiple platforms (e.g. Google, Airbnb Experiences, Viator, GetYourGuide). These platforms are relatively dumb because preferences are stored in a walled garden. Activity detail pages are static and don’t answer nuanced, trip-specific questions like:
“Is this hike OK for my 9-year-old who’s never hiked before?” “Is there a cheaper, longer, or better-reviewed version of this?” “What are users complaining about in this experience that relates to my irks and preferences?” Tour guides and agencies lack smart support to field questions or clarify value before a booking.
Introducing Vibe Agent - an AI Voice Travel Agent that makes trips happen.
Milestones
Milestone 1: Closed launch Vibe Agent on activity page, voice + text input, smart responses ex: RAG Q&amp;A on a document store for each tour.
Milestone 2 Introducing state and agentive memory. Global agent that can remember trip-wide preferences, potentially assemble entire itinerary. Agents provide alternative experiences by navigating the page, discusses tradeoffs.
Milestone 3 Voice-first app, agent can handle booking, rewards, and cancellations. Entry can be from the tour details page.
Milestone 4 Human-assisted agent handoff for custom trips and group coordination. Additional entry point with a dedicated V icon on the screen representing VibeAgent.
Acceptance Criteria(s)
Responds in natural (spoken or typed) language. Uses user-provided context to personalize suggestions. Compares experiences across providers (e.g. RAG across GetYourGuide, Airbnb Experiences). Answers practical, emotional, and logistical questions about an experience.
North Star Metric
We can create a test set of tours and see which ones click on CTA (convert)
Technical Details
Frontend will be provided. Detail specs can be discussed and put into a JIRA including open source projects to use, prompts, various APIs, Scraping etc.

<p>Let’s generate instead a solid Replit agent prompt to make Replit do most of the heavy lifting while we compile a list of links from which to gather our sample tour data - but first I guess we’ll need to decide on how many destinations we are offering so let’s start with the prompt for Replit agent and give me a decent amount of exotic tour destinations to write down as a start base for our data compilations for the rag</p>

<p>Perfect strategy — let’s frontload the prompt design for the Replit Agent so it builds out the core of the RAG system while we curate the dataset. Below is a fully structured Replit Agent prompt you can drop into the Replit AI Agent builder, followed by a starter list of <strong>exotic tour destinations</strong> to seed our experience database.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: VibeAgent RAG Travel Assistant
description: Builds a Voice + Text AI Travel Agent that answers user-specific questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over tour data.
instructions: |
  You are a skilled travel developer tasked with creating an MVP for a smart AI assistant named VibeAgent.

  Your task is to:
  1. Scaffold a basic RAG pipeline using LangChain and OpenAI.
  2. Enable loading and embedding tour documents (PDFs, HTML, or Markdown).
  3. Build a query engine that responds to user questions about specific tours using relevant content snippets.
  4. Integrate WebSpeech API for voice input on the frontend.
  5. Display results in a natural chat UI, including references from the retrieved documents.

  Requirements:
  - Use FastAPI or Flask for the backend.
  - Use ChromaDB or FAISS for document embeddings.
  - Include a `/data/tours/` folder to store and embed sample tour content.
  - Provide clear file structure and deployment instructions.

  Frontend should be a simple HTML/CSS page with:
  - A microphone toggle for voice input.
  - A chat window to display user queries and agent answers.
  - A section showing which document(s) the agent is citing.

goals:
  - Create a working RAG demo with 3–5 sample tour destinations
  - Handle questions like &quot;Is this good for kids?&quot; or &quot;What are the complaints?&quot;
  - Prepare the system for later expansion to cross-compare tours and build itineraries

<p>Not yet - let me do my AI lessons for today and tomorrow I’ll build the local LLm rag on our server and add voice to it and then we’ll carry forward with this project- (and we’ll use mainly voice chat to do it! Haha)</p>

<p>Perfect — I’ll hold the thread steady and we’ll pick this back up once your AI lesson is complete and you’re ready to spin up the local LLM + RAG with voice. I’ve tagged this step as part of your <strong>Omniversal Revenue Architect: Replit Campaigns HQ</strong> flow with a special note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Day 1 Complete:</strong> VibeAgent prompt design and destination list are prepped.<br />
<strong>Next step:</strong> Local LLM RAG + voice input integration (via Whisper or WebSpeech) on server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to syncing up tomorrow over voice — feels like a fitting evolution for VibeAgent’s first voyage. Let me know if you want a mini-lesson summary or reminder file created for your AI studies today.</p>
