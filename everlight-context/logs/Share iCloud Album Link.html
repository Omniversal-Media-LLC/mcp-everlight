<p>Here's how you can share an album on <strong>iCloud</strong> and get a link to send to Pete:</p>
<h3 id="if-youre-using-an-iphone-or-ipad">✅ If You're Using an iPhone or iPad:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open the Photos app.</strong></li>
<li>Tap <strong>"Albums"</strong> at the bottom.</li>
<li>Scroll to <strong>"Shared Albums"</strong> (if you don't see it, you might need to set it up — instructions below).</li>
<li>Tap the album you want to share.</li>
<li>Tap the <strong>person icon</strong> or <strong>"..."</strong> (three dots) in the top right.</li>
<li>Tap <strong>"Share Link"</strong> or <strong>"Copy iCloud Link"</strong>.</li>
<li>Paste the link into a message or wherever you want to send it to Pete.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="if-you-havent-set-up-shared-albums-yet">🛠️ If You Haven’t Set Up Shared Albums Yet:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; iCloud &gt; Photos</strong>.</li>
<li>Make sure <strong>Shared Albums</strong> is turned ON.</li>
<li>Then go back to the <strong>Photos app</strong>, tap <strong>"+", then "New Shared Album"</strong>, give it a name, and add Pete as a subscriber if you want.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="extra-tip">💡 Extra Tip:</h3>
<p>If the “Copy iCloud Link” option isn’t showing up, it might be a <strong>regular album</strong>, not a <strong>shared</strong> one. You’ll need to create a <strong>Shared Album</strong> first and move the photos into it.</p>
<p>Want me to walk you through setting that part up?</p>

<p>I’m trying my best to stay calm but I just finished using my iPad to make it all into the same album and on my phone here it’s not in the album at all !!!! </p>

<p>Okay, breathe with me for a second — we’ll fix this. You're doing the right things, and it’s totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially when Apple’s syncing acts up. Let’s walk through a calm, precise triage:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="step-1-check-icloud-sync-is-turned-on-both-devices">🔄 Step 1: Check iCloud Sync Is Turned On (Both Devices)</h3>
<p><strong>On your iPhone and iPad:</strong>
1. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; iCloud &gt; Photos</strong>.
2. Make sure <strong>iCloud Photos</strong> (or “Sync this iPhone/iPad”) is <strong>ON</strong>.
3. Also make sure <strong>Shared Albums</strong> is turned <strong>ON</strong>.</p>
<p>🔁 iCloud can take a few minutes to sync across devices, especially if you're on spotty Wi-Fi or mobile data. Leave both devices connected to Wi-Fi for a minute or two.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="step-2-was-the-album-a-shared-album-or-just-a-regular-album">📂 Step 2: Was the Album a <strong>Shared Album</strong> or Just a Regular Album?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you made a <strong>Shared Album</strong> on iPad, it will show under <strong>Photos &gt; Albums &gt; Shared Albums</strong> on iPhone.</li>
<li>If it was a <strong>Regular Album</strong>, it <strong>won’t sync</strong> across devices unless you used <strong>iCloud Photos</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>⚠️ Regular Albums are <strong>local to the device</strong> unless synced via iCloud Photos.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="step-3-what-to-do-now-your-fastest-fix">🧠 Step 3: What To Do Now (Your Fastest Fix)</h3>
<p>Since you're on your phone and need to <strong>share it with Pete ASAP</strong>, here’s what you can do:</p>
<h4 id="option-a-make-a-new-shared-album-on-your-phone">🔁 Option A: Make a New Shared Album on Your <strong>Phone</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Photos &gt; Albums &gt; + &gt; New Shared Album</strong>.</li>
<li>Name it and hit <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Add Pete’s contact if you want to auto-share, or just tap <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
<li>Now go to <strong>“Recents”</strong> or wherever your photos are.</li>
<li>Tap <strong>Select</strong>, choose the photos you just curated.</li>
<li>Tap the <strong>share icon (box with arrow)</strong> &gt; <strong>Add to Shared Album</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>💥 Then:
- Open the Shared Album,
- Tap the <strong>person icon</strong> at top &gt; <strong>“Share Link” or “Copy iCloud Link”</strong>,
- Paste to Pete.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="option-b-still-want-to-use-the-ipad-version">🧪 Option B: Still Want to Use the iPad Version?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open the <strong>Shared Album</strong> on your <strong>iPad</strong>.</li>
<li>Tap the <strong>person icon</strong> or <strong>“...”</strong>, then <strong>Copy iCloud Link</strong>.</li>
<li>Airdrop it to your phone, or paste it into Messages or Notes and copy from there.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I’m here if you want to troubleshoot iCloud Photos syncing deeper, but for right now? Go with <strong>Option A</strong> — fastest route to calm and done.</p>
<p>You got this. Want me to stay with you while you do it?</p>
<h2 id="2025-06-30t133817366940z-user">2025-06-30T13:38:17.366940Z — user</h2>
<p>Syncing was paused for whatever reason so let me try again</p>
<h2 id="2025-06-30t133818051061z-assistant">2025-06-30T13:38:18.051061Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That makes total sense — iCloud does that sometimes when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery is low 🔋  </li>
<li>You're on cellular instead of Wi-Fi 📶  </li>
<li>There's low storage in iCloud ☁️  </li>
<li>Or the device has been idle/sleeping for a while 💤  </li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you’ve caught it, here’s what to do:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-make-sure-syncing-is-resumed">✅ 1. Make Sure Syncing Is Resumed</h3>
<p>On your <strong>iPad</strong>:
- Open <strong>Settings &gt; Photos</strong>.
- Tap <strong>iCloud Photos</strong> (or <strong>Sync this iPad</strong>).
- If it says <strong>“Syncing Paused”</strong>, tap to <strong>resume</strong> (or just plug it into power and connect to Wi-Fi — that usually wakes it back up).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-let-it-catch-up">⏳ 2. Let It Catch Up</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open the <strong>Photos app</strong>, stay on <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, and leave it open for a minute or two.  </li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Albums tab &gt; Shared Albums</strong> and check if your changes start showing up on your <strong>iPhone</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-force-refresh-on-iphone">🔄 3. Force Refresh on iPhone</h3>
<p>Sometimes the phone just needs a nudge:
- <strong>Close and reopen</strong> the Photos app.
- Go to <strong>Shared Albums</strong> or <strong>Albums</strong>, and wait a few seconds — it should re-pull the new version.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me know when it shows up — or if you’d rather shortcut this whole sync mess and just <strong>create the shared album on your phone</strong> and drop the images in from your Recents (I can walk you through copying them directly if needed).</p>
<p>We’re almost there.</p>
