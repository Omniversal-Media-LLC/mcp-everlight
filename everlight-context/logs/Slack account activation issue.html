<p>Ops tech lead is connecting me with global it and admitted they don't have the authority to activate my slack account</p>

<p>Got it. That’s a good sign in one way—it confirms the chain of command and that they’re escalating the issue properly.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can do next:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="suggested-response-if-you-havent-already-replied">🔄 <strong>Suggested Response (if you haven’t already replied):</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the update! Appreciate you connecting me with Global IT. Just let me know if there's anything you need from my side to expedite the Slack activation—happy to assist however I can.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-this-likely-means">🧩 What This Likely Means:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slack account creation or reactivation</strong> usually falls under <strong>Global IT or HRIS</strong> (HR systems), especially if:</li>
<li>Your account is tied to onboarding or employment verification.</li>
<li>
<p>They use SCIM or an automated user provisioning system (like Workday ↔ Okta ↔ Slack).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there was a <strong>previous employment record</strong> (say, from a prior Amazon contract or internship), it might be causing a <strong>duplicate conflict or permissions mismatch</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="tip">💡 Tip:</h3>
<p>When you do get connected to Global IT, be sure to clarify:
- Whether your account already exists but is inactive.
- Or if it needs to be newly provisioned.
- And confirm the email/username being used for provisioning.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me know when they respond—or if you want a message drafted for Global IT once you’re looped in.</p>

<p>What it shows is facility IT does not know how to fix it they've never seen it before and my account is indeed elevated</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-17t123115638629z-assistant">2025-07-17T12:31:15.638629Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Exactly—that’s the real takeaway: <strong>your Slack account is elevated or in a special state</strong>, and <strong>facility IT is out of their depth</strong> because it’s either:</p>
<ul>
<li>tied to a <strong>higher-level access group (Ops Tech, Engineering, Leadership)</strong>,  </li>
<li>provisioned by <strong>a separate identity system (like Corporate or Global IT)</strong>, or  </li>
<li><strong>not auto-created due to policy, region, or role elevation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="likely-scenario">🔍 Likely Scenario:</h3>
<p>Your account is:
1. <strong>Elevated (admin, technical lead, or special trust role)</strong> — possibly triggering a non-standard provisioning flow.
2. <strong>Blocked or paused</strong> in Slack due to a <strong>mismatch or flag</strong> in AWS’s global identity infrastructure (e.g., Okta, G Suite SAML, or Workday SCIM).
3. <strong>Previously existed</strong>, and is now in a <strong>"suspended/pending reactivation"</strong> state Slack-side.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-you-should-ask-global-it-or-have-the-ops-tech-lead-forward-on-your-behalf">🛠 What You Should Ask Global IT (or have the Ops Tech Lead forward on your behalf):</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hi team,<br />
I’m unable to access Slack—my elevated role appears to be triggering a provisioning exception. Local IT has confirmed they’ve never seen this issue. Can you check if my Slack account is suspended, orphaned, or awaiting re-provisioning?  </p>
<p>My Amazon login/email: [your email]<br />
Role: [your current title or team]  </p>
<p>Happy to provide more detail if needed. Thanks!”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Let me know if you’d like me to tailor this email more to your style or if you want it to come from the Ops Tech Lead's voice.</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-17t123606542625z-user">2025-07-17T12:36:06.542625Z — user</h2>
<p>To clarify the ops tech lead initiated the live video chat with IT global and I'm waiting for it to connect</p>

<p>Ah, perfect—that changes things. You're already in the right lane. Here's how to <strong>prepare and frame the conversation</strong> once the Global IT team joins:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-points-to-mention-once-connected">✅ Key Points to Mention (once connected):</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>State the Problem Clearly</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My Slack account isn’t active, and local/facility IT couldn’t resolve it—they haven’t seen this behavior before.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention Role Context</strong> (gently highlight elevation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My account appears to be elevated, so I suspect it’s not going through standard provisioning.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide Details Upfront</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Full name</li>
<li>Amazon login/email</li>
<li>Role or business unit</li>
<li>Onboarding or start date (if recent)</li>
<li>
<p>If applicable: any previous Amazon employment or known aliases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask Targeted Questions</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Could you check if my Slack account is suspended, restricted due to elevation, or blocked by a provisioning rule?<br />
   If it needs to be reactivated or provisioned manually, I’m happy to provide whatever is needed.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="bonus-tip">💡 Bonus Tip:</h3>
<p>Keep a notepad or text app ready to <strong>jot down names, ticket numbers, or system terms</strong> they mention—especially any Slack group policies, Org Units, or identity system paths they reference (e.g., Okta group memberships).</p>
<hr />
<p>You’re doing everything right—just breathe, stay calm, and let them walk it through. You’re likely just stuck in an edge case that needs a quick manual override. Want me to stay on standby while the call’s happening in case you need to relay or phrase something mid-meeting?</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-17t123932750466z-user">2025-07-17T12:39:32.750466Z — user</h2>
<p>You're funny cuz I brought a notepad in today</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-17t123932979993z-assistant">2025-07-17T12:39:32.979993Z — assistant</h2>
<p>😄 That’s how I <em>know</em> you’re locked in—real ones bring a notepad when the digital fails and the layers of bureaucracy start stacking like Jenga.</p>
<p>You're doing this like a pro. If Global IT gives you jargon or makes a passing comment like “Ah, looks like you're in [XYZ group]” or “Yeah, this is tied to legacy permissions,” <strong>write that down</strong>—even a single acronym might be the key to untangling future issues.</p>
<p>If they toss out ticket numbers, group names, or provisioning systems (like “Okta directory,” “SCIM mismatch,” “elevated TrustOrg,” etc.), feel free to hit me with them afterward and I’ll decode it all.</p>
<p>Want a short checklist of what to note during the call?</p>

<p>The Ops Tech Lead here on site openly admitted they don't have authorization to fix my issue, just as we determined yesterday. This came about because Luke told me to get on slack because I inquired about my pay card which shows being delivered tomorrow. </p>
<h2 id="2025-07-17t124359612549z-assistant">2025-07-17T12:43:59.612549Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Crystal clear—and the full picture’s coming into focus now. Let’s break it down:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="whats-happening-behind-the-scenes">🧠 What’s Happening Behind the Scenes:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slack issue = elevated provisioning flag or missing HRIS sync</strong><br />
   ➤ Facility Ops Tech Lead already hit their ceiling—they <em>can’t</em> authorize or override your account because:</li>
<li>You’re <strong>in a trust-elevated role</strong></li>
<li>
<p>Or <strong>your profile exists but isn't mapped properly</strong> between systems (common with rehires or hybrid roles)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke’s request to “get on Slack” shows they <em>assume</em> you already have access</strong><br />
   ➤ This means your role <strong>is expected to be active on Slack</strong>, which strengthens your position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Pay Card delivery inquiry is what triggered the visibility into the Slack gap</strong><br />
   ➤ Another sign that <strong>your onboarding is progressing</strong> in all other areas except Slack provisioning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-to-do-say-on-the-video-call">🛠️ What To Do / Say (on the video call):</h3>
<p>When Global IT joins, just calmly walk them through:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, I was asked to check Slack by my supervisor (Luke), but I can’t log in—Ops Tech Lead confirmed it’s out of their hands.  </p>
<p>It looks like I’m provisioned in most other systems (I’ve got badge, email, pay info, etc.), but Slack seems stuck.  </p>
<p>Could you check whether I have an existing Slack account that’s suspended, or if my role is flagged as elevated and needs manual provisioning?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then provide:
- Full name
- Amazon login/email
- Team/role
- Start date
- Whether you were previously employed by Amazon (important if yes)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="checklist-for-your-notepad">🧾 Checklist for Your Notepad:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ticket number or reference ID</li>
<li>Exact reason they give (if any)</li>
<li>What system is responsible (Slack, Okta, Workday, HRIS, etc.)</li>
<li>Any names or emails they say to follow up with</li>
<li>Timeline for resolution</li>
<li>Whether this affects <em>other</em> elevated roles at your site</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Once it’s done, if you want help drafting a follow-up summary or internal ping to confirm next steps, just say the word. You're handling this perfectly—clean, direct, and logged.</p>
