<p>Here’s a polished draft you could send to Yue Zhao (hiring manager) that balances humility, initiative, and clear interest in long-term career alignment with <strong>Agentic AI at AWS</strong>:  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Interest in Learning Paths Toward AWS Agentic AI (L5 Role, Job ID 3064079)  </p>
<p>Hi Yue,  </p>
<p>My name is Ethan Womack, and I’m currently with Amazon in [your current role/team]. I came across the posting for the <strong>Software Development Engineer, Agentic AI Foundation (L5)</strong> position (Job ID 3064079, SEA113, Bellevue) and it immediately caught my attention.  </p>
<p>I’m deeply interested in aligning my career toward AWS AI/ML—particularly in the emerging space of <strong>Agentic AI systems</strong>. While I’m not at the stage to formally apply yet, I want to start preparing now. I’d greatly value any guidance you could share on:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning paths or skill development</strong> you recommend for someone aiming to eventually contribute to Agentic AI at AWS.  </li>
<li><strong>Tips or resources</strong> that could help me begin building the right technical and architectural foundations.  </li>
<li><strong>Slack groups, internal forums, or communities</strong> I could join to learn more, connect with others in this space, and follow the team’s work.  </li>
</ul>
<p>From my current role, I bring [insert 1-2 sentences about your reliability/automation/engineering background—e.g., systems reliability, automation pipelines, or distributed infrastructure insights]. I believe these experiences could one day serve as a bridge into the kind of large-scale, mission-critical engineering your team is pioneering.  </p>
<p>I recognize your time is valuable, and I’m very grateful for any advice you can offer to help me chart a long-term path toward contributing to AWS Agentic AI.  </p>
<p>Thank you for considering, and I hope to cross paths with your team in the future.  </p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ethan Ross Womack<br />

<p>Would you like me to <strong>make this leaner and more informal</strong> (almost like a Slack-style DM), or keep it as a <strong>professional polished email</strong>?</p>
