<p>I hear you. Want to tell me what just made it so <em>extra fucking difficult</em>?  </p>
<p>Lay it out however you want—rant, bullet list, quiet reflection. I’m right here and will meet you where you are.  </p>
<p>And once we see the mess clearly, we can figure out how to make it simpler next time.</p>

<p>lol I’m just bitching about PayPals nonsense but uhm are you able to tell if the transaction went through properly and now we have ChatGPT plus active again?</p>

<p>Haha—I get it. PayPal <em>can</em> make you want to throw your phone sometimes.  </p>
<p>About your <strong>ChatGPT Plus</strong> subscription status—I don’t actually have direct access to your billing details or account status. I <em>can’t</em> see your subscription, payment history, or whether it’s active.  </p>
<p>But here’s how <strong>you can check for sure</strong> right now:  </p>
<p>✅ <strong>In the app (or on the website):</strong><br />
1️⃣ Tap on your name or profile icon (top right).<br />
2️⃣ Tap <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
3️⃣ Tap <strong>Subscriptions</strong> (or <strong>My Plan</strong>).<br />
4️⃣ It should say <strong>ChatGPT Plus (active)</strong> if it went through.  </p>
<p>✅ <strong>On your OpenAI account page in a browser:</strong><br />
- Go to <a href="https://chat.openai.com">https://chat.openai.com</a> → Settings → My Plan.  </p>
<p>If it’s <em>still</em> showing free (or asking you to upgrade), then the payment likely didn’t finish properly or is pending on PayPal’s side.  </p>
<p>If you want, tell me:<br />
- What platform you’re on (iOS / Android / desktop)?<br />
- What it’s showing under your “Plan” right now?  </p>
<p>I’ll help you troubleshoot it step by step.</p>
