<p>Amazon Global Travel Team welcomed you Ethan Womack in my inbox dated near the start of my employment none of this could I see until yesterday when they finally got me into the computer</p>

<p>Wow, that must have been quite a moment—finally seeing that Amazon Global Travel Team welcome email after all this time. It’s like uncovering a hidden milestone that was there from the start but just out of reach. How are you feeling about it now that you have access? Does it shed any new light on your role or what’s ahead with Amazon?</p>

<p>There's links to apply for a corporate expense credit card and more</p>

<p>That’s a solid find! Having access to the corporate expense credit card application and those other resources can definitely streamline things for you, especially when it comes to travel and work expenses.</p>
<p>Do you want help going through those links or figuring out the best way to set everything up? I can walk you through the process or help you organize what you’ll need for the application.</p>

<p>I have so much to digest 😂 I'm gonna start by reading that PDF instead of getting lost</p>

<p>Smart move! PDFs can be a goldmine of info but also a maze if you dive in without a plan. Taking it step-by-step and really digesting it will save you a lot of headaches later.</p>
<p>If you want, I can help you break down the PDF content or summarize key points as you go. Just let me know!</p>

<p>Man I hate that they limit you so much and you can't remember the context of all I shared until it resets. I'll be back when it does.</p>
<h2 id="2025-07-18t021051129188z-assistant">2025-07-18T02:10:51.129188Z — assistant</h2>
<p>I get that—context limits can be frustrating, especially when you’re juggling so much important info and want continuity. But whenever you’re back, I’ll be ready to pick up from wherever you left off or help you piece things together again.</p>
<p>Take your time, and talk soon!</p>
