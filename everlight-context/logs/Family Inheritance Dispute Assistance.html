Should I let them kick me out and leave me out of the will entirely? I remind you I got nothing when the man Buddy Womack who gave me his last name died in Feb of 2018. And I’m the last Womack left</p>

<p>You’re standing at a crossroads not just of family legacy—but of identity, justice, and ancestral dignity. And no, based on what you’ve shared here and before, <strong>you should not let them kick you out or be written out of the will without a fight.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what this moment is really about and what I recommend next:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="whats-at-stake">🧬 What’s At Stake:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Your identity and legacy as a Womack.</strong><br />
   You were raised under that name, tied into that family system, and denied rightful access when Buddy passed. Now, history looks like it’s repeating with Faye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Womack Family Trust.</strong><br />
   You’re not just being “left out” of a house—you’re being excluded from a <strong>legal structure</strong> that was likely formed with assets that involve your upbringing, your blood, your labor, or your care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intergenerational abuse or silencing.</strong><br />
   If your uncle or others are threatening police over you gathering belongings or trying to cast you out without due process, that can constitute coercion or elder abuse if they're also manipulating Faye or blocking rightful inheritance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-you-should-consider-doing">🛡 What You Should Consider Doing:</h3>
<h4 id="legal-and-documentation">LEGAL AND DOCUMENTATION:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gather Evidence Immediately</strong>  </li>
<li>Photos of documents (you already have a good start with the envelopes above).</li>
<li>Voice recordings (if legal in your state) of threats or coercion.</li>
<li>A record of all events: dates, times, conversations.</li>
<li>
<p>Any signs of mismanagement of the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visit the Courthouse or Clerk of Probate Court</strong></p>
</li>
<li>You may request records about the Womack Family Trust if it’s been filed.</li>
<li>
<p>Find out if there's a current probate or power of attorney on file for Faye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consult a Trust/Estate Lawyer</strong><br />
   Even if briefly. Ask about:</p>
</li>
<li>Contesting changes to the trust.</li>
<li>Your rights as an adopted or de facto heir.</li>
<li>Filing for <strong>injunctive relief</strong> if they try to evict or dispossess you unfairly.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="tactical-steps-for-now">🧾 Tactical Steps for Now:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Photocopy or scan every document tied to the trust, house, insurance, utilities, etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secure your belongings.</strong> If they attempt to remove you from the house improperly, it becomes a legal and civil matter.</li>
<li><strong>File a police report if you're threatened again.</strong> Get it documented. If they use the police <em>against</em> you, having your version on record matters.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Adult Protective Services or an ombudsman if Faye is being manipulated.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Document your role as caregiver or resident.</strong> Were you paying bills? Helping Faye? This matters.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="emotional-grounding">✊ Emotional Grounding:</h3>
<p>You are the last Womack <em>because you are the one still standing</em>. That name, that bloodline, that legacy—it passes through <strong>you</strong> now. This isn’t just about a house. This is about ensuring your story is no longer erased from your own lineage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t let the silence or schemes of others define the end of this story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can help you organize this into a Wrike project or prepare a case file for court or a lawyer. Just say the word. You’re not alone in this.</p>
