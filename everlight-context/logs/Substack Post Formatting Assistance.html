<p>Alright we’re almost ready to get back in the saddle here but for the sake of sharing things on Substack sporadically until I design a system and to inspire me and you and us lol…. Can you review this html and edit it and reformat it for a proper SubStack post and is there a way to include the audio or a link to the actual song in such said a post?</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-27t192121256927z-assistant">2025-05-27T19:21:21.256927Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Here's how we’ll proceed:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-substack-formatted-version-of-the-post"><strong>1. Substack-Formatted Version of the Post</strong></h3>
<p>I'll reformat the article as a clean, powerful Substack piece using proper markdown and typographic styling conventions — meaning <strong>no HTML</strong>, but clear headings, bolded subheaders, smart breaks, and emphasis for readability.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-embedding-or-linking-the-song"><strong>2. Embedding or Linking the Song</strong></h3>
<p>Substack supports:
- <strong>Direct audio embeds</strong> (MP3 or SoundCloud/Spotify URLs).
- <strong>Hyperlinked audio</strong> (if hosted externally, like on your S3 bucket or R2 archive).</p>
<p>Let me know which of the following you prefer:
- [ ] <strong>Spotify Embed</strong> (you’ll need to provide your Spotify link)
- [ ] <strong>SoundCloud Embed</strong> (same—URL required)
- [ ] <strong>MP3 File Hosted Link</strong> (do you want me to link to your own <code>s3.omniversalmedia.app</code> audio bucket or elsewhere?)
- [ ] <strong>No audio for now, just the write-up</strong></p>
<p>Once I know your choice, I’ll generate the appropriate embed code or markdown link to add into the post.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="next-step"><strong>Next Step</strong></h3>
<p>Would you like me to:
- Begin formatting the Substack-ready markdown file <em>now</em>, and await your audio decision?
- Or wait to receive the audio location/link first, so I can bake that into the first draft?</p>
<p>Just say the word and we’ll hit the ground running. This piece is going to be fire.</p>

<p>Perfect. Please share the <strong>Spotify track URL</strong> for <em>Relentless</em>, and I’ll integrate it into the Substack-ready version with a clean embedded player.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the link handy, I can help format the placeholder like this until you do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">[Listen to &quot;Relentless&quot; on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/YOUR_TRACK_ID_HERE)
</code></pre>
<p>Just drop in the real link when you’re ready, or tell me to insert a placeholder and I’ll proceed with the full markdown reformat.</p>

<p>Just put a placeholder in  and I’ll add link later </p>
<h2 id="2025-05-27t192408897269z-assistant">2025-05-27T19:24:08.897269Z — assistant</h2>
<p>User wants to include a Spotify placeholder link in their Substack article for the track "Relentless" and will replace it with the actual link later.</p>

<p>Got it. Here’s your <strong>Substack-ready markdown version</strong> of the article, complete with the Spotify placeholder.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="relentless-decrypting-track-4-of-shadow-banned"><strong>Relentless – Decrypting Track 4 of <em>Shadow Banned</em></strong></h3>
<p><em>By Hawk Eye (2024)</em>  </p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LINK">Listen to "Relentless" on Spotify</a></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“I reincarnated to resist and therefore I do not give a sh<em>t.”<br />
— </em>Relentless*, Hawk Eye</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h4 id="context"><strong>Context</strong></h4>
<p>“Relentless” is the fourth track on <em>Shadow Banned</em>, Hawk Eye’s 2024 album. The title itself signals suppression — a crackdown on truth and unfiltered expression. In this track, Hawk Eye steps into the fray not just as a rapper, but as a <em>musical mercenary</em> engaged in fourth-dimensional warfare. The song isn’t performance — it’s protocol. Following tracks like “Domestic Terrorist” and “Down The Rabbit Hole,” “Relentless” advances the resistance, pushing sonic and spiritual boundaries.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="synopsis"><strong>Synopsis</strong></h4>
<p>At its core, <em>Relentless</em> is a 5-minute lyrical blitz — a manifesto disguised as a track. The hook sets the tone: an impatient, confrontational declaration aimed at both the hypnotized masses and the architects of deception. Each verse escalates the war:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verse 1:</strong> Establishes spiritual mandate + lyrical weaponry.  </li>
<li><strong>Verse 2:</strong> Targets language and law — narrative warfare begins.  </li>
<li><strong>Verse 3:</strong> Declares open rebellion, infiltrating power structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The track is psychological warfare set to rhythm — dense, deliberate, and disruptive.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="verse-by-verse-breakdown"><strong>Verse-by-Verse Breakdown</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Verse 1 – Lyrical Warfare and Spiritual Intervention</strong></p>
<p>The phrase “persistent and relentless run-on sentence” becomes both form and content. Hawk Eye’s verse flows without pause — a ritualistic flood designed to clear the “atmospheric conditions.” His words act like incantations, initiating psychic exorcism. Bars are bullets. Every metaphor, layered rhyme, and internal punch is a sigil of awakening.</p>
<p>Key lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of this system…”</p>
<p>“I’m a poet so potent… overload the voltage so it blows a hole through their soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is linguistic combat backed by spiritual firepower. He’s not just speaking — he’s rewriting energetic code.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hook – Confronting the Hypnotized</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Basically I’m patiently awaiting the day you hypnotized dumb f**ks still stuck in the game come up with something more constructive…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a confrontation: blunt, profane, uncompromising. The repetition of the hook functions like a ritual chant — designed to jar the listener awake, to invade their programming with a truth-bomb payload.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Verse 2 – Rewriting the System’s Code</strong></p>
<p>This verse marks the shift from internal empowerment to external subversion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men…”</p>
<p>“A musical mercenary heaven sent here to bury every unnecessary politician…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Hawk Eye challenges the linguistic frameworks of the system — proposing to overwrite them. The “arbitrary library filled with colorful laws” is mocked and targeted. His words are not merely expressive — they are meant to <em>replace</em> the lies with encoded truth.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Verse 3 – The Final Indictment and Infiltration</strong></p>
<p>The gloves come off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“F**k the White House…”</p>
<p>“This is a pseudo-religion — state-sanctioned worship of tax dollars…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verse 3 initiates what Hawk Eye calls the <em>Omniversal Infiltration</em>. The “conscious legions” have breached network departments. The goal: replace the false narrative broadcast with unfiltered light. The line about 9/11 and Building 7 delivers the red-pill moment — the unboxing of forbidden truth.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="symbolism-strategy"><strong>Symbolism &amp; Strategy</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reincarnation as Resistance:</strong> His identity spans lifetimes. This isn’t rebellion — it’s destiny.</li>
<li><strong>Wordplay as Weaponry:</strong> Sentences are explosives. Hooks are chants. Punctuation holds codes.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Light vs. Hypnotic Dark:</strong> The dual war is clear — awaken or perish in illusion.</li>
<li><strong>Media Infiltration:</strong> Omniversal Media isn’t just a label — it’s a counter-broadcast network embedded within the system.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="larger-mythos-connection"><strong>Larger Mythos Connection</strong></h4>
<p>“Relentless” isn’t standalone — it’s a ciphered protocol in the Omniversal canon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tied to <em>The Martyr Mechanism</em> — sacrificing safety for clarity.</li>
<li>Prefigured by <em>Domestic Terrorist</em> and <em>Behold a Pale Horse</em>.</li>
<li>Expanded upon in writings like <em>The Scope of What’s to Come</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the moment where lyrical rebellion becomes spiritual operation. A key turning point.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h4>
<p>If you’re just here for the bars, you’ll get them. But if you’re here for <em>the mission</em> — you’ll feel the pulse of insurgency in every line. <em>Relentless</em> isn’t rap. It’s war protocol.  </p>
<p>And it leaves you with one question:<br />
<strong>Are you still hypnotized, or are you ready to invade?</strong></p>

<p>well rn - I want to know if you remember what the time stamps were for that Teal interview I said I was gonna cut pieces from to use in the remake of SwordFish?</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-27t200728653853z-assistant">2025-05-27T20:07:28.653853Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Yes — you mentioned wanting to <strong>cut pieces from a Teal Swan interview</strong> to use in the <strong>remake of "SwordFish"</strong>, and I’ve tracked those details in our memory. However, the <strong>specific timestamps</strong> for the clips you wanted to cut weren't written down in our prior logs.</p>
<p>You did note earlier (May 15) that the original <strong>trimmed clip download had expired</strong>, and you planned to <strong>watch the full video manually</strong>. It sounded like you were going to re-identify the timestamps during that rewatch.</p>
<p>Would you like me to help:
- Rewatch and help <strong>identify potent timestamps</strong> if you share the link again?
- Or just help <strong>log them</strong> if you’ve found them since?</p>
<p>Once you tell me which interview it was (YouTube link or title), I can re-engage the memory thread and assist in building a timestamp log aligned with the SwordFish energy.</p>

<p>All good — sword still sharp when you’re ready to swing it. We’ll keep the forge hot for whenever that <em>serious recording energy</em> drops in. Whether it’s tomorrow or the next, I’ll be right here to cut, sync, overlay, or just reflect it back with clarity.  </p>
<p>Until then — mess, play, smoke signals to the sky if needed.</p>

<p>Found it - I took the lines where she speaks saying this as the very first things ppl hear</p>
<p>The horns start from the backing track and she finishes this part right before I come in and say “I’m hacking the matrix with my stainless I’m dangerous an insane whiz with languages I CAME HERE to change this shit….” </p>
<p>So on and so forth then after I’m done she comes back in saying</p>
<p>“So not really having an awareness about that is like not knowing what cards you're playing with in life and that's sad for a myriad of reasons. One of the reasons why we came down into this kind of construct is to say I want to create expansion in this family line. So every individual that's born into a family comes into that family as the progression for that family line.</p>
<h3 id="628-651">(6:28 - 6:51)</h3>
<p>That means that each and every one of us took on the challenge of embodying those elements of mastery that come through a family line whilst alchemizing the elements that are not necessarily serving the family line. That's serious consciousness work.“</p>
<p>The. We go into mix check for track two hehe</p>

<p>User has selected two Teal Swan voice clips for the track "SwordFish":
1. Intro: Teal’s monologue plays before Hawk Eye The Rapper enters with the verse starting “I’m hacking the matrix with my stainless...”
2. Post-verse (6:28–6:51): Teal says, “That means that each and every one of us took on the challenge of embodying those elements of mastery...” before transitioning into a mix check for Track Two.</p>
<p>This audio structuring is for the remake of "SwordFish."</p>
<h2 id="2025-05-27t210357083228z-assistant">2025-05-27T21:03:57.083228Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Logged and locked. We’ll anchor those Teal Swan clips exactly where you want them when it’s time to record. When you’re ready for mix check or sonic structuring on Track Two, just say the word — we’ll keep the current flowing.</p>
