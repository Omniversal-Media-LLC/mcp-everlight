<p>How is it possible that Uber is showing rental cars for $17/day?</p>

<p>It’s totally understandable to do a double-take when you see Uber rental car rates for something like <strong>$17 per day</strong>—it seems almost too good to be true. Let me break down why that can happen and how it's really possible:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-uber-rent-prices-can-be-that-low">Why Uber Rent Prices Can Be That Low</h3>
<h4 id="1-uber-partners-with-major-rental-companies-like-hertz-avis-budget-fox-and-others">1. <strong>Uber partners with major rental companies like Hertz, Avis, Budget, Fox, and others</strong></h4>
<p>Uber Rent acts as an aggregator—listing deeply discounted rates from these partners, especially for hassle-free airport pickups. citeturn0search3turn0search6</p>
<h4 id="2-airport-deals-drive-down-the-cost">2. <strong>Airport deals drive down the cost</strong></h4>
<p>At places like <strong>LAX</strong>, rates for economy cars start at <strong>$17/day</strong>. It's a reflection of competitive pricing, typically for rentals spanning around a week. citeturn0search8 At <strong>Orlando International Airport</strong>, the cheapest economy option is around <strong>$11/day</strong>, with an average of <strong>$23/day</strong> for a full week. citeturn0search6</p>
<h4 id="3-market-discountsseasonality-availability-and-fleet-utilization">3. <strong>Market discounts—seasonality, availability, and fleet utilization</strong></h4>
<p>These low prices are often a result of:
- Off-peak demand or promotional discounts.
- Rental companies looking to move excess inventory rapidly.
- Competitive pricing between brands to attract short-term renters—especially at airports. citeturn0search6turn0search8</p>
<h4 id="4-longer-rentals-dilute-daily-rates">4. <strong>Longer rentals dilute daily rates</strong></h4>
<p>While the <strong>$17/day</strong> sounds great, it's usually tied to longer rentals, like 7+ days, where rates drop significantly. citeturn0search6turn0search8turn0search3</p>
<h4 id="5-included-perks-may-not-be-shown-in-the-headline-rate">5. <strong>Included perks may not be shown in the headline rate</strong></h4>
<p>Though enticing, these low rates often don’t include:
- Taxes
- Insurance or coverage fees
- Deposits (e.g., Hertz may require ~$200 refundable deposit) citeturn0search5turn0search12turn0search6</p>
<p>Most Uber rental offers <strong>do include basic insurance and maintenance</strong>, but optional add-ons, local taxes, or required deposits can significantly raise your final cost. citeturn0search0turn0search12turn0search5turn0search6</p>
<h4 id="6-special-offers-for-evs">6. <strong>Special offers for EVs</strong></h4>
<p>In some cases, Uber offers <strong>electric vehicles (EVs)</strong> at lower operational costs because:
- Charging is often cheaper than gas.
- Uber may incentivize EV usage through extra earnings or promotions. citeturn0search0</p>

<h3 id="reddit-drivers-share-insights">Reddit Drivers Share Insights</h3>
<p>On communities like r/uberdrivers, drivers mention inflated weekly rates despite headline deals; many had to factor in deposits or higher hidden fees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anything is possible. $275 per week seems more likely… starts from $150, insurance included.” citeturn0search2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another driver noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a $200 refundable deposit. That's why it's 575. You'll get that 200 back…” citeturn0search2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It underscores that those low rates are often initial figures, and actual out-of-pocket costs can be meaningfully higher after all fees.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-should-do-to-maximize-savings">What You Should Do to Maximize Savings</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check availability in your area</strong>—like Orlando vs. LAX—or wherever you’re planning to rent.</li>
<li><strong>Review the “more details” section</strong> in the Uber app: scope out the final breakdown including fees, deposits, and insurance.</li>
<li><strong>Compare across suppliers</strong> (e.g. Hertz vs. Avis) to identify which offers the best all-in pricing.</li>
<li>If you’re planning a longer rental, <strong>calculate your true daily cost</strong> by dividing your quote including all fees and deposit by the number of days.</li>
<li>For rideshare usage, <strong>EV rentals may give you financial perks</strong> like lower charging costs or Uber-specific bonuses.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>So yes—$17 per day rentals through Uber are indeed possible, especially at certain airports or during promotional periods. However, always dig deeper to confirm what the final cost will actually look like once everything’s added in.</p>
