NetRunners(hacker mercenaries) are paid by various corporations to carbon-copy competitor apps to dilute the competing market. The purported way out is with new technology solutions that beat the paradigm, so that copycats are hard to produce. However, that just gets your startup company bought out by a mega corporation: which is the real 'only way to make money' in this era.

The type and length of notice depend on the reason for eviction. For nonpayment of rent, 27-40-710(A) requires a five-day written notice demanding payment. If the lease includes a clause waiving this notice, the landlord may proceed without it. For lease violations, 27-40-710(B) mandates a 14-day written notice specifying the violation and allowing time to correct it. If the tenant remedies the issue, the lease remains in effect; otherwise, eviction can proceed. Some violations, particularly those causing irreparable harm, may not allow for correction.
